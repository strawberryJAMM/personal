<p><b>Mystara</b> is the name of an out-of-print Fantasy Gaming World created by 
TSR for its original Role Playing Game, Dungeons and Dragons. The creative 
property is now owned by <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd"><i>Wizards of the 
Coast</i></a> but they currently have no plans to revive this campaign world. 
However, there are many people on the Internet who still love this world and 
have not-so-quietly been maintaining and expanding it in typical Net-Fashion.</p>
<p>This is actually a pretty plain-jane web page where I've placed a few Mystara 
and
<span title="0th-Edition = Basic, Expert, etc. D&amp;D and the D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia">
0th-Edition</span> related tid-bits -- some of my own stuff and pointers to a 
few other interesting or useful online sites:</p>

<h2><a name="community"></a>Mystaran Community</h2>
<p>There are many fans, myself included, who still interested in working on 
developing bits and pieces for Mystara and discussing the implications of 
details found in many of the (now OOP) source material for this campaign world. 
Most of our developments and refinements can be found on the web page that has 
been sanctioned by <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/"><i>Wizards of the Coast</i></a> 
as the <b>Official Mystaran Home Page</b>:</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The craftsmen of Darokin are among the finest in the Known World. As 
      such, the goods which they produce are greatly valued and highly sought 
      after. Just When world of a new artisan of exceptional talent reaches the 
      market place, there is often a frenzy of speculation about his or her 
      future and a great deal of haggling over the worth of their existing 
      pieces. It is just such and event that brings the characters face to face 
      with a true fiend in this adventure. </p>
      <p>A female artisan by the name of Matrissa has suddenly taken the Darokin 
      Art World by surprise. Rumours of her talent and skill for crafting 
      magnificent stone busts has spread throughout the city. She works only in 
      jet and produces pieces of such detail and quality that none like it has 
      been seen in recent history. Exactly four of her works are on display at a 
      local museum/art gallery in the city of Darokin, brought to the city by 
      Simon Treemonsha, an Elf from Akorros, who is well known as an agent of 
      Toney House. No other examples of her work are known to have been sold to 
      private individuals and speculation on the eventual value of her art is 
      high. The works on display are to be auctioned off in a few days time, and 
      the success or failure of this auction will partially determine what will 
      happen in the art world.</p>
      <p>In this module, the PC's either decide or are hired to make a voyage to 
      Matrissa's home (which is known to be south of Akorros) in response to the 
      success of the auction. This journey has one primary purpose: to purchase 
      as much of her work as the characters can for as little as they can. If 
      they're lucky and play their cards right, they might make a pretty penny 
      from this venture. On the other hand, perhaps there is more to this Artist 
      than meets the eye, and things may not work out at all according to plans…</p></td>

<p>This is an alternative Wizard Magic System that I used to use when I ran a 
campaign using &quot;0E&quot; D&amp;D. It is extensively based on a system for AD&amp;D of the 
same name that was created by <a href="http://www.darkwood.org/sj/www/tbliv/">
Leroy Van Camp</a>. My version has been seriously modified for use in the world 
of Mystara using &quot;original&quot; D&amp;D rules.</p>

</ul>
<p>The above links give access to a selection of text files which contain parts 
of the accumulated discussions between several Mystara Fans concerning the 
potential development of a region with a primarily &quot;Oriental&quot; flavour on Skothar, 
the second mystaran continent in the north, which is (as yet) primarily 
undeveloped by both TSR/WotC and even other Mystara Fans. Unfortunately, the 
project team splintered due to lack of time for many individuals and so, the 
original incarnation of the &quot;MOrient Project&quot; went dormant. What work was done 
has been picked up by the &quot;Skothar Project Team&quot;:</p>
<p>Yahoo! Groups &quot;Skothar&quot; mailing list -
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/skothar/">
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/skothar/</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>That's the place for more recent MOrient developments (which were always 
centred on the continent of Skothar). Not the most active of project teams, 
either, it's at least possible to read up on past discussions and find uploaded 
files with ideas that have been developed (or refined) more recently.</p>
<p><b><i>NOTE:<br />
</i></b><i>The text files and images found here have not been &quot;tidied up&quot; by me 
in any way and are primarily being stored in this public forum as a means of 
ensuring that what discussions were had remain available to any one who would 
like to continue explorations in this direction in the future. Additionally, 
since the team is defunct, please consider any and all &quot;decisions&quot; to be moot. 
If you wish to take these ideas and develop them further do not feel restricted 
by any thing these documents or files indicate as they were all very preliminary 
even before the group fell appart.</i></p>
