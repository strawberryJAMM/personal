MORIENT Material Compilation v0.2

	Well here it is. The long awaited second compilation of the MOrient  
material. It’s in the same format as the first, but with different headings, as  
different subjects were discussed. There’s also a review of the results of the  
first poll, a couple of important questions for us to vote on and some  
interesting quotes from version 0.1. Actually I think I’ll put the voting 
questions on the webpage, the all you’ll have to do is read through the material  
and then check the page and e-mail me. At this point I’d like to congratulate  
everyone on the fine work that’s been done and the level of enthusiasm. I know  
you’ve kept me on my toes sifting through an enormous amount of material trying  
to organize it in some understandable fashion. Keep up the good work! Without  
any further long winded speeches by your humblest bookkeeper, here it is, enjoy! 
 
“And my son, so as there are many planes of existence, and as the one we live  
in is the central one of them, the plane of Prime-material, just as well is our  
divine and eternal country in the exact center of the Prime plane and so we can  
call it Central Prime. We are truly in the true heart and center of the  
multiverse, and in  the exact point, in the exact centre of the Multiverse,  
Universe and Prime is the Seat of our Emperor, the Dragon.”

“I decided to lead an expedition up the coast a few miles in each direction in  
order to see what could be discovered.  After a couple of miles we spotted  
something shining in the distance ahead of us.  You can imagine my surprise when  
I saw, as we drew closer, a full-fledged town.  Here!  In  what everyone knows  
is the absolute middle of nowhere!  At first glance, I would have to guess that  
this town is about as big as home, back in Mafertat, Frisland, Alphatia.  The  
homes were primarily made out of wood with straw and mud to seal them, and many  
small fishing canoes were moored along a full half-mile stretch of the shore and  
along the slow mouth of a wide river.  The people going about their business in  
the town were undoubtedly human, but their complexion was unlike any other that  
I have seen.  If I had to guess, I'd say that they were closest to the Jennites.   
They wore fairly typical clothes for this climate—scant and brightly colored,  
but not indecent.  Aside from its size, it seemed to be a fairly typical native  
village, except for the great temple or palace structure of some sort at the  
center!  It's gracefully soaring, curving architecture towered over the rest of  
the town, dwarfing it in comparison.  But the most astonishing thing was that  
this structure was covered with what appeared to be gold!”

Review 
================================================================================ 
 
	The statements in this review ( aside from the comments ) are taken from  
the results of the first poll and should be regarded as canon material for the  
MOrient project. The comments are simply people’s suggestions to add more detail  
to some of the statements. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The immortal Rohindartha will be one of the religions/philosophies used 
- Clerics of Rohindartha have the ability to “deanimate” undead and to calm 
  intelligent undead. 
 
Comments:  
 
	Rohindartha can be like the Mystaran version of Buddhism.  Though I am 
far from well-versed in the beliefs of a Buddhist, I have been reading up on  
Japanese history, and inclusion of this religion first from Sind to MChina, and  
then from MCHINA to MJapan would be very accurate. 
	As for MJAPAN, they would have been some form of animists (along the  
lines of the Shinto religion), probably worshipping a pantheon of Immortals who  
are aliases for current Immortals (though not a Sun-Goddess, Ixion falls very  
similar to a Japanese creator goddess). Rohindartha could be the second type of  
religion which makes up the whole conglomerate that far eastern religion seems  
to be. 
 
Estlor 
 
I would require some lengthy ritual to calm an intelligent undead. If that is  
included I'd say allow it, otherwise, no. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The Fairy/Seelie court model will be used for the Celestial Court 
 
Comments: 
 
I've been thinking about this one and I believe drakes would be perfect in  
MChina. Their original form is draconian, they can shapeshift to human (or  
elfish or dwarven) form at will. Besides, PCA1 tells us they have started  
fighting law so that no other Blackmoor, with their destructive power, could  
ever rise again. Most of them have forgotten their origins, but those in MChina  
haven't. 
 
Drakes should form a secret society, dedicated to destroy any blackmorian  
artifact discovered in Skothar and to prevent MChina to rise as a world power.  
And they account for part of the pantheon. The occasional finding of blackmorian  
devices could explain why the fairies are more interested in MChina than in the  
nations in Brun. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
But be sure to do some research for appropriate Chinese names. 
 
David Knott 
 
Use with modifications - many of the types listed in, for instance, PC1 are far  
too Western, but if we treat them as a template to build off of, modifying for  
cultural variances, then we would not only have an excellent MChinese Celestial  
Court, but also the basis for the MJapanese kami.  They might even have contact  
with Oberon and Titania's Seelie Court as 'our esteemed Imperial cousins in the  
distant barbarian lands,' and treat them as distant near-equals. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Gabriele’s Barbarians will be used  
 
Comments: 
 
	This seems very well thought out and should be used.  From reading the  
Complete Barbarian's Handbook, one should keep in mind that barbarians typically  
fear wizard spells as bad omens ('bad magicks').  Shaman, on the other hand, are  
openly welcomed. 
 
Estlor 
 
With slight modifications - for instance, that the barbarian humanoids aren't  
necessarily evil, just barbaric - akin to the real steppe tribesmen or the  
humanoids of the Broken Lands.  I also recommend that whoever ends up developing          
them do some sincere research into the various steppe tribes of Asia - there's a  
lot of interesting distinctions and details there just waiting to be used. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The “Hairy Red Thing” humanoid seemed to be particularly loved and will 
  stay. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The Steppes of Jen will be inhabited by Jennite Horsemen. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The Emperor of Chung-Eun is an Oriental Dragon (at least he’s supposed to be) 
 
Comments:  
 
if, by supposed, you mean "believed to be mythologically", in the manner that  
Egyptians believed their pharaohs to trace lineage all the way to Ra, but they  
never did anything to prove this, and people didn't care, then yes. 
 
Simon Seah 
 
	This could bring plenty of good adventures into existence...think of the  
trouble a party would have to go through to check to see if the emperor has  
truly been replaced by a mage or not.  Everyone will think he is a dragon, but  
there will be no evidence. 
 
Estlor 
 
I like the idea of a throne that no human may sit on, perhaps an artifact  
granted by the Immortal patron of MChina (The Great One?).  There have, however,  
been emperors who were other races shapeshifted into human form, and even, once,  
when the humanoid barbarians overran MChina, a gnoll who usurped the throne and  
held it for his entire lifespan (paralleling the real Chinese dynasties of  
Mongol or other steppe barbarian conquerors). 
 
Scott 
 
Comments: [regarding the whole of Chung-Eun as being a dragon] 
 
it's not real, but common people think it's true! 
[regarding the whole of MChina being a dragon] 
 
Gabriele 
 
	I think that oriental dragons need some place in Mystara, and if you 
let the regular dragons in that would jeopardize the placement of Oriental  
dragons. 
	And as for the MCHINA being a dragon, well, that could use a little  
tuning for use.  It could be something similar to Ulimwengu, where the land is  
the only thing the Karimari worship, and some (perhaps powerful artifact, like  
the one that created the seers of Yavdlom) has embued the land with the "dragon"  
nature. 
 
Estlor 
 
Yes, but only metaphorically - people refer to the land as if it was a dragon,  
more specifically as if it were an extension of the Emperor. Place names based  
on parts of a dragon's body are moderately common, and the weather and social  
climate can be seen as the dragon's temper - 'The Emperor smiles on us today' if  
it is sunny and pleasant, or 'the Dragon is rumbling' if the populace is growing  
frustrated of an overbearing governor.

- The Emperor can have Half-Dragon offspring 
 
Comments: 
 
Although, I prefer true dragons,  Dragon King gets bored, abdicates to eldest  
child, goes away and doesn't care anymore. That he doesn't care thereafter lets  
us have reigns based on the present Dragon King's whims (in turn perhaps  
connected to his age). 
 
Simon Seah 
 
(but only if the emperor is actually a dragon) 
 
Estlor 
 
Very rare, and with human features. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
However, they're extremely rare - one in a generation would be an auspicious  
sign of fertility, and many emperors go their whole lives without offspring. 
 
Scott 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Dragon blood is required to be imperial royalty 
 
Comments: 
 
	I think only the Emperor requires dragon blood, but loyal and worthy  
humans could become the remaining lesser nobility for the country. 
 
Estlor 
 
Perhaps not necessarily dragon, but some sort of special lineage 
 
John 
 
That is the law, but it is considered an insult, punishable by death if you are  
wrong, to doubt the draconian blood of a rightful noble. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
Probably not for all levels of nobility, but definitely for the emperor. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- There will be a Great Wall, above ground, below ground and with magical  
  properties. 
 
Comments: 
 
The wall should definitely be substantial, and I think above-ground - a 
huge chasm is mildly impressive, but the Wall should be impressive because 
it's man-made.  And it should be physical - humanoids, for instance, who 
are the ones it's most likely to be erected against, aren't exactly going 
to be cowed by mere darkness, and would keep on charging into a 
mind-affecting region time and time again until they get through by sheer 
stubbornness and persistence, simply because most of them wouldn't 
understand what was going on. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Chung-Eun will not have more magical power than Alphatia 
 
Comments: 
 
on the condition that the draconian rulers (if we use them) are 
on par in political ability and firepower with the Alphatian Council. 
 
Simon Seah 
 
As [much] magical power as Alphatia, but not so much organized..... 
 
Gabriele 
 
There certainly should be a lot of magic in MChina, but not the 
semi-organized, wizards-behind-every-door magic of Alphatia.  Instead, 
there are reclusive hermits with celestial powers, colonies of mysterious 
magical animals who act like humans and with great charms and potent 
secrets, hidden caves and glens where the spirits gather, mysterious tomes 
and scrolls that are legacies of the great philosophers of the past, minor 
divinations and charms used everyday that are *probably* just folk ritual 
but nobody knows for sure...  mystical happenings, superstitions, and 
strange and wondrous sights, but relatively little organized, public 
magic. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Chung-Eun will have a national philosophy of dealing with foreign problems by  
  avoidance. 
 
Comments: 
 
 
....But could change during WotI events!! 
 
Gabriele 
 
Fits quite well with the real China's outlook at some points in the past. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Jikushiru will be located on Zyxl and founded by refugees from Chung-Eun 
 
Comments: 
 
But still known by outsiders as Zyxl, above assuming we are putting the nation  
at island of Zyxl.  Also, reading through the possible meaning of the name of  
Jiku Shiru, one possibility might be "Know Root"  Something to tell people to  
remember where they come from. 
 
John 
 
As the one who proposed the name, I'd like to ask for some time so I can find a  
suitable name composed entirely of kanji (the imported Chinese characters that  
convey meaning, not just sound) - someone else suggested several meanings for  
Jikushiru, but they tended to include the infinitive form of a verb, which I'm  
not sure is entirely appropriate.  I'll get back to you on this as soon as I get  
back to my kanji dictionary. 
 
Scott 
 
One possibility, the island is settle by one of MChina's huge 
sea expeditions that never came back.  Some historian actually  
believe this is how Japan got colonized. 
 
John 
 
Not entirely, at least - I think that some refugees would be appropriate, 
but having taken a course on Japanese and Chinese history since I proposed 
this, I think that at most, they would have founded only one of many uji, 
or small households/kingdoms that made up the prehistory of MJapan. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- In legend the island(s) of Zyxl is formed out of a dragon body 
 
Comments: 
 
In mythology I think it should be, if that's what you mean. 
 
David Melik 
 
...Not actually true, but MJapanese believe it 
 
Gabriele 
 
This could be a common belief by the population 
 
John 
 
Probably as a legend, but it's worth thinking about.  It doesn't have to be  
true, just what people tell each other. 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Jikushiru is matriarchal 
 
Comments: 
 
Assuming that it could be reasonably reconciled with the history of MJapan. If  
you build MJapan from scratch, a mother-earth culture might conceivably lead to  
a matriarchal society. Somehow they avoid a theological shift to worshipping  
patriarchal sky gods.  Might shape the content of MJ too much, though. 
 
Simon Seah 
 
	If we decide to put MJapan at Zyxl, we should decide what sort of climate  
it has.  And if we going to have a tropical Zyxl, do we want another more  
traditional MJapan. 
 
John 
 
Me too - and looking at actual Japanese history, it wouldn't require much of a  
change at the start.  (Many of the uji of Japan's prehistory were matriarchal,  
and there are tales of a sun priestess-queen of one of the uji who might be  
connected to the actual Imperial line...) 
 
Scott 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- The Nentsun Plateau holds an MTibet/MShangri-La surrounded by hostile

Comments: 
 
That would be a perfect place for the shrine where one or more of the 
Immortals receive those who want his/her/its sponsorship for Immortality. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
And, for an ironic twist, MShangri-La is a paradisical city inhabited by 
peace-loving, philosophical, friendly humanoids. 
 
Scott

Hiding Chung-Eun 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Hi, 
 
I've been away for sometime and I am happy there was lots of stuff to read 
to know how the project is going on. 
 
There are a few ideas I had when reading that material that I'd like to 
discuss with you all. 
 
I've always felt oriental stories to deal with illusions and mind more 
than anything else. That might be one more key to hide MChina from the 
rest of the world. What I mean is that there is a class of magical 
bureaucrats in MChina, a kind of thought police. When a foreigner arrives 
at MChina shore, he will always find a happy and prosperous nation and he 
will be invited to stay, so that no word of the nation spreads to the 
world. Long ago, this policy was considered more efficient than repelling 
any contacts. Visitants are treated as important guests until they decide 
to settle in this wonderful country and integrate into the society. 
 
Of course, some of them will want to go back to their homes. That's when 
those bureaucrats enter into play. They never told he couldn't go away, 
just that he could stay as long as he wished, so nobody will think about 
departing without a good-bye but thieves. The bureaucrats specialize in two 
kind of magics:  
 
- Those useful to detect any try to escape unnoticed. Those people who 
try to do it are judged as criminals and sentenced to death. 
 
- Mind-affecting magic. The travelers are convinced that they should not 
depart, they are much better right there. This magic takes days to cast 
in a very subtle and undetectable process (by anyone not versed in their 
arts). Most people forget about their outer world concerns and never goes 
back to their homes. A few, however, are able to resist their suggestions. 
In these case, the most powerful bureaucrats cast a powerful forget spell 
that changes the memories of the affected. Usually, the rest of the crew 
of a ship has decided to stay back, so they give him memories of a 
shipwreck in an inhospitable land and take him out of the boundaries of 
the country. This way, Alphatia might even know nothing about them. 
 
And then, we shall have a week without magic, when somebody who survived 
the trip back will recover his real memories. What do you think? 
 
This would turn MChina in a darker place, where controlling somebody's 
mind is a common thing, but would give us lots of opportunities for 
adventures. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Depending on where you place MChina, you may not have to go to too much  
trouble to hide it.  Remember, this nation is very isolationist.  We can 
assume that its nearest neighbors are quite familiar with it, while  
nations such as Alphatia know about it do not want to advertise the fact.   
After all, why wake the sleeping giant? 
 
But Alphatia is one reason that the magical brainwashing would be a very 
bad idea -- unless it is done with Immortal level magic.  Remember, if some  
Alphatian explorer visits MChina and then manages to leave with an altered 
memory, it is likely that something may go wrong with the spell once he 
returns to Alphatia -- some other wizard may detect that something is wrong 
and proceed to investigate.  Once the Alphatians realize that people are 
either disappearing or losing their memories in a certain part of the world, 
they would become VERY curious about the place -- and that is the last 
thing MChina would want. 
 
But one interesting possibility is that Alphatian propaganda was constantly 
poo-pooing the idea that there are any civilized empires on Skothar -- and 
they were generally believed as long as nobody but Jennite barbarians and 
Minaean pirates were contradicting them.  However, once Alphatia was out 
of the picture, people would realize that these people were not just making 
up their story of a great "anti-Alphatian" empire in the east. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alphatia would certainly know about it, if there aren't very well prepared 
measures against it. All those skyships flying around for hundreds of 
years (btw, does anybody know when the Alphatian skynavy was developed?), 
some of them were bound to have overflown MChina, bringing news of it 
earlier to Alphatia. And that would have attracted the attention of several 
curious wizards to such a prosperous land. I could accept that only the 
empress and a handful of people knowing the existence of MChina would be 
no trouble, but if entire crews get back to Alphatia, too many people 
would be aware of their existence. So, shipwrecks above MChina would be in 
order. 
 
If Eriadna knew about MChina, I would suggest there is an enigmatic 
prophecy that sages have interpreted as: When Thyatis learns about MChina, 
Alphatia will not exist on the world anymore. Then we shall have WotI and 
the prophecy is fulfilled.

It might be done with an artifact in the capital. Whenever a foreigner 
will leave the country, no matter what they say, he is invited to the 
capital. The emperor himself wants to send presents to the visitant liege. 
There in the presence of the Dragon Throne, he forgets. We might even rule 
that one of the handicaps of the Throne is forgetfulness (dragons are 
immune to the effect) and they just put it to a good use. 
 
The Throne powers would include ship detection. Whenever a ship gets near 
MChina coast or MChina airspace, he who is sat there knows about it. 
Appropriate measures are taken. Many times, some dragons are sent to chase 
the ship away, so Alphatia believes the Nations of Dragons claims these 
lands. After the problems they had with them during the Dragonlord of 
Mystara series, they are not willing to provoke those mighty beasts and 
Eriadna makes sure everybody believes this to be the case. At other 
occasions, when they feel the crew has already seen too much, they invite 
them to stay, as I described in my previous post. Only then, the charming 
and the brainwashing occurs. 
 
And then we have another possibility. When Alphatia is destroyed, master 
Terari sees it as the fulfillment of the prophecy (he was Alphatian 
emperor, so he knows about it). There is no reason for secret anymore and 
he might tells king Stefan about the nation. This way, after the 
expedition to the Hollow World, Stefan might want to finance another 
discovery journey. The age of great navigations is open, with Karameikos 
playing the role of Portugal or Spain.

Yes, good enough. But why this culture has disappeared?  
I'd like best primitive culture. You know the tiny bears in the 3rd  
(I think) Star Wars movie? Something like that. What about halflings or  
leprechauns (there's a good article about that somewhere at www.tsrinc.com)? 
Uh, by the way, how can "halfling" be translated in Chinese? 
 
Gabriele 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
EWOKS!  Of Course!  My favorites!  BTW, I have a question about the pictures 
for the Savage Coast Monstrous Compendium: does anyone know what that furry  
ewok-ish thing with the spear twice his size is? 
Anyway, I like the idea of some sort of secret civilization, whether it be 
halflings or leprechauns or ewoks:)  Halflings in particular could make 
sense, because they apparently colonized Norwold centuries ago, so they 
could very well have crossed the sea to settle Skothar.  Speaking of which 
(kind of), it seems likely that at least a few elves from the Sylvan Realm 
would have crossed the Sea of Brun and colonized Skothar at some point. 
Perhaps there should be some isolated elvish settlements in MTibet or 
nestled in secret valleys of the Tangor Chain. 
 
Patrick 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
At the other size,(sorry :) I have always wondered why there are so many 
giant races and no giant nation. Some of them are intelligent enough to 
have developed civilization, but there was no place in the maps for them. 
I would suggest they are part of the reason why MChina is isolated. One, 
maybe several, giant nations could have hidden the nation from Alphatia 
and the rest of the world. A number of small city states in permanent war 
would be nice. The Alphatians have met those giants and concluded they 
were just barbarian giants continuously fighting each other. If they were 
to invade their territory, they might unite and present some serious 
treat. So they were left undisturbed in their wars. Once in a while, a 
group would have been sent to make sure they were still fighting each 
other, but just that. 
 
Andre Martins 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Yes, that's a good idea too. I propose that we start splitting up in  
groups to develop the main ideas for each area. I'd like to be in the  
Humanoid-Forest Culture group...

1014 Almanac 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
I was reading the new Almanac and I found a passage the is directly 
related to our project. In the History of Alphatia section, there is an 
entry about the Ochaleans that hint that the Alphatians have sent some of 
the MChina ancestors to Ochalea in 300 AY (700 BC). The interaction 
between Alphatia and MChina at that time could have been determinant to 
the beginning of Chung Eun's isolationism. Any ideas about how that 
happened?

Geography and Celestial Court 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
First of all, regarding to the map Patrick made.  To me 
MChina is a bit too small, but I'm probably a little biased:) 
But I actually come up with a few thing regarding to the 
size of MChina, more on that later.  I like the rivers in 
MChina, as Chinese has quite a bit of myth regarding to 
rivers (which culture doesn't), this allow me to incorporate 
some of them.  Is MManchuria supposed to be many separate 
tribes or one unified nation?  If it is one nation, at that 
size it would probably dominate the MOrient.  Also, what 
was the original reason for putting MEthopia in MOrient, it 
felt slightly out of place.  I would also like MChina to 
be a little closer to MJapan, so more conflict can be 
created between them. 
 
Now about MChina, in order to incorporate as many time periods 
of historic China into the game, and make an interesting 
adventure background, I'm thinking of the following: 
MChina was quite a bit stronger than now, but certain event 
has weaken it recently (perhaps the WotI).  So now the actual 
MChina emperor is weaker, and much power have shifted to the 
regional Kings or Dukes (about 3 to 7 in number with real power, 
there might be even more of them, but they don't have enough 
resources to compete with the big boys).  Each of those Lords 
is eyeing the Dragon Throne, but to declare that openly will 
give the other Lords the reason to attack him, so each are 
claiming they want to protect the emperor and like help the 
emperor to unify the empire again.  Each of the territory 
control by the Lords can be based on different time period 
or region of historical China.  The relationship between 
MChina and neighboring nations are becoming unstable too. 
At the time when MChina was dominating, most of the 
neighboring nations and barbaric tribes near MChina's 
border send annual tribute to MChina's capital.  But now 
only a few of them still do so, and some of them are 
actually starting to test the water and skirmishing across 
the border. 
 
Based on the MO poll, seems like most people does not 
object the Celestial Court/Seelie Court connection. 
So I'm thinking based on PC1, the fairies are exiled 
immortals, so perhaps, MChinese and maybe other 
MOrientals were the descendent of the original followers 
of those immortals.  And agreement between the MOfairies 
and immortals allow them to keep this region somewhat 
isolated from rest of Mystara.  For one reason or the 
other the MOfairies are more interested in the mortal 
affair than their western counterparts, and try to 
guide them.  One way to do so is by incarnate into 
human babies.  When a fairy does that he lost his 
memory, but the baby generally grow up to be quite 
exceptional.  So even if he was from a poor family 
he quickly reaches position of power.  And at critical 
time, his old fairy friends will reveal the truth or 
at least part of truth to him either through dream 
or a surreal encounter.  Generally at a time, there 
are a handful of those "changeling" in the mortal 
realm with one the emperor.  The fairy that does this type 
of incarnation often are a special type unique in MOrient. 
They are generally associated with some type of animal and 
in fairy form, they can polymorph into those animals at 
will.  Even incarnated into human, sometime when asleep 
or unconscious, their sprite escape the body and the animal 
form seen.  Some of those fairy includes the White Tiger 
which generally becomes general that defend the country, 
the Black Dragon who becomes barbaric leaders that lead 
invasion into MChina to test and strengthen it (or to 
cause a change in dynasty if one stray too far from the 
path), the Gold Dragons which become (hopefully) the 
emperors.  A few rogue fairy such as the Giant Toad and 
the Rat, meanwhile, try to cause chaos and disruptions 
in MChina.

The fact that everything in the area is called "Tangor something" implies 
that the Tangor culture is or was at play here.  MAfrican cultures would 
make sense in Eastern Skothar as remnants of tribes left behind when Ka 
moved the Tangor to the Hollow World.  I'm not sure who originally made the

simply be loose tribes of barbarians with cultural ties.  Perhaps we should 
extend Chung-Eun further eastward into the mountains?  I really don't think 
it should extend all the way to the Sea of Brun, though.

I like the basic premise, but I don't think the fairies should be quite 
this powerful.  It seems to trivialize the role of humans (and dragons, if 
they are the real rulers).  Perhaps if the fairies could manipulate events 
more subtly than taking the throne?  Fairies could be the rulers of several 
of the smaller dominions.

I deleted a massive amount of David's explanation for accepting my

The mountains should definitely be broken up, and the highlands and  
mountains should stretch for many miles south of the sword. How's this:   
The Jennite Sword itself is a very long, sharp, crest running the entire 
length of the range. It is somewhat similar to the Himalayas.  From the Chung- 
Eun 
side, it looks like a long range of toweringly high, sharp peaks.  But the 
Steppes on the north side gradually slope up to the sword, so that in places the  
mountains rise over 5,000 feet above the steppe, but in many places there 
are large gaps allowing access into Chung-Eun.  It is through these large 
gaps that the hordes attack.  Perhaps the high terrain is always covered with 
clouds, like David described for the Wall. We should definitely add a number of  
additional rivers as well. 
 
>I think a lot of the geographic detail is just up to the creativity of the

In the real world, China's capital moved several times throughout history. 
The stuff I cut out all looks great, it just takes up too much room.

I like the idea of the mist, but I'm not sure that it's necessary. Chung-Eun  
should be the MOriental nation with the largest population by far. It is 
also located in the center of the MOrient, with civilization steadily decreasing 
the further from the seat of the Dragon Emperor one goes.  "Central" is also  
largely psychological; they think primarily of themselves, they are the 
center of civilization, the pinnacle of humanity, the object of creation, etc.  
Every-thing is inward-focused, so naturally, Chung-Eun is the center of the 
universe. 
 
Patrick 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Well, we've still got to reach a consensus, but I think I can give some 
help.  Here's my opinion.  I think we should go with what Patrick has on his 
map for MChina, and here's why.  I looked at an atlas, and examined 
Mystara's maps more closely. According to the atlas, on Earth even much of 
modern-day China is forested, and has a lot of highlands.  In MChina on 
Patrick's map, we have highlands and forest, and it appears the Jennite 
Sword is the northern part.  Look at Skothar on the Mystara map.  If you 
measure the width of the land on the river going to Tangor Bay, it's about 
100 to 200 miles across, and 3400 miles long, and a river this size has to 
have tributaries.  There's even more plains around the mountains, with 
smaller rivers of course.  Now even *without* Jennite Sword as a part of 
MChina, I'd say there's *plenty* space for farming (but I'd like to keep the 
Jennite Sword as part of it, for sheer size of the empire).  Think of the 
*scale* here, and compare it to the countries of the Known World. If some of 
us wanted farming to be important in MChina, it would be better *where it 
is* on Patrick's map than farther out on the steppes of Jen where there are 
less rivers rushing down from the mountains.  Maybe the Jennite Sword could 
be where the Jennites always attacked MChina if it is where it is on 
Patrick's map, and the above-ground wall could go along it, separating it 
from MTibet and the Steppes of Jen.  If we don't reach a consensus soon, we 
need another vote.  Not having a place set for MChina is truly starting to 
hinder us.

Basic Descriptions 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
So, let's see. 
 
We've ideas for a giant civilization and a halfling/leprechauns/ewoks (I like  
this one so much!) civilization. 
I agree with the others that it's better for us to focus on Chung-Eun and Jiku- 
Shiru, but we need a little info about all the other cultures (just to know the  
background...). So here's what I think (we need only a few quick infos): 
 
giant civilization could be quite developed, but MChinese (and all the others  
people) don't think so. You know, they could have an average knowledge, but  
maybe they don't show it. I think they should live on high mountains and have a  
very 'close' culture, like some people who lived in the north of Italy and in  
Austria a few centuries ago. (uh, no offense intended to Austrian people, I go  
there every winter and I like them very much...) 
 
the 'little' civilization (halflings or leprechauns or ewoks) shouldn't have  
many contacts with other people. They should be, in fact, like a legend for  
other people. 
 
see you soon 
Gabriele Ferri - fif3336@iperbole.bologna.it 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Actually, one thing in regard to this - I was thinking of using the 
halflings elsewhere in the MOrient - namely, as the MOrient equivalent to 
the Ainu, the aboriginal residents of Japan.  It would be a slightly 
different and novel role for them to play, and the real Ainu have at least 
sufficient points of similarity to the Hin (Hinu?) that they'd be 
interesting and plausible.  
 
Also, while I'm actually writing this, I'd like to suggest a narrative 
device to help with the description of the societies.  I recall reading, 
at one time, perhaps in one of the fan-written 'net.Almanacs', about an 
explorer (possibly Thyatian?) who was going to try to circumnavigate the 
world.  It seems to me that a ship and crew such as this would be the 
perfect opportunity for the Known World to first discover the lands we'll 
be creating.  We could do Princess Ark-style overviews of the countries, 
then flesh out the details the crew wouldn't have seen.  It's still 
nothing definite, as an idea, but it's a thought.  
 
And one final thing: it occurs to me that, even with MKorea as a stepping 
stone, there's a fair distance between Chung-Eun and Jikushiru (which I 
*will* find a good translation for if it kills me!), possibly enough to 
make them not really prone to interaction or cultural influences. 
Therefore, might I make a suggestion: along the southern and southeastern 
coast of Skothar, various factors have come into play and created an 
extremely fast current and accompanying winds.  They're treacherous to 
sail, but if you read the currents right and navigate skillfully, travel 
time moving along it (say, from Chung-Eun to Jikushiru, or, at night when 
the current reverses, vice-versa) is greatly reduced.  This might also be 
another factor in Chung-Eun's isolation - traveling perpendicular to the 
current is not easy, and if there's a treacherous barrier reef on the 
south side of the current to channel it appropriately, it might be quite 
hazardous to navigate past it...

This looks like it would work well.  I know very little about the Ainu, but 
halflings would probably work.  The other option would be Tanagoro people, 
since the Tanagoro people originated very near there.  Here's an idea that 
might work:  The Halflings migrated from Central Davania to Thanegia Island 
between 2800BC and 1500 BC.  While still on Davania, a smaller group, the 
"Hinu," broke off and followed the north coast of Davania around to the 
northwest tip of that continent, arriving there around 1400 BC.  Hostile 
humanoids came down from the Arm of the Immortals around 1100 BC, and the 
Halflings fled by sea, finding Zyxl to be uninhabited.  They settled there 
and lived peacefully until the humans from MChina (or wherever) invaded 
their homeland.  This would mean that Jiku-Shiru would have been founded 
sometime after Alphatian Landfall in 1000 BC.  Please look at the rough 
timeline that I am proposing based on various ideas and, more, on the dates 
given on the Mystaran Migrations map.

Hi everyone.  Attached is a rough map of Skothar (jpg) with what I think would  
be good locations for some nations of the MOrient.  I think I included  
everything from the poll; if I missed something it was an accident.  I also  
added several things: a new river (there will, of course, be many once we get  
detailed maps drawn up), nations of Southeast Asia that were only vaguely  
mentioned, nations of MNepal and MBhutan (in case anyone would like to detail  
them), and a general MManchuria on the Tangor peninsula. I was thinking that for  
this probably it would be best to have most of the mountains crawling with human  
barbarians and humanoids.  They could have barbaric Manchurian customs in the  
North, tending more towards African customs in the south. MEthiopia could be a  
calm, civilized nation hidden amongst what the residents of Chung-Eun and Zyxl  
consider to be a completely barbaric area (kind of ironic).  This way, Chung-Eun  
could be threatened by foreign barbarians from both sides: Jen and Tangor. These  
are just some rough suggestions.  Please let me know what you think. 
 
Patrick 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This definitely makes sense.  I think that we should have some sort of 
Oriental Barbarians (related to Tanagoro or Jennites, or humanoids) near the 
border with Chung-Eun at the very least, But south of that I agree that a 
more African civilization should exist amongst the descendants of the 
Tanagoro.  I like the demi-ogre idea, even though I've never read the article.

IMO, it's important to take into consideration that modern China includes 
much of what was historically Mongolia, Manchuria, or Tibet.  Historic China 
was made up primarily of the hills and river valleys relatively near the 
coast.  They are covered in varying degrees by forest or jungle, much of 
which has already been destroyed to make way for farming and development. 
China never really stretched out into the plains of Central Asia until this 
century, so I personally think it would be best to place it nearer the coast. 
It could either stretch into part of the plains, or perhaps there should be 
a Great Wall at the crest of the Jennite Sword? 
 
>3) Most of the other suggested locations look good. 
 
Thanks!  I appreciate your suggestions.

Here are basic outlines for various nations of the MOrient:  Some of these 
are my interpretation of other people's ideas, some are my own.  This is 
only a suggestion, please give any suggestions possible to improve them. 
 
-MChina (Chung-Eun):  Humans of Jennite ancestry.  Ruled by an emperor, 
possibly a dragon.  approximately 5 million people? engages in limited 
commerce with its southern neighbors, MKorea, and MJapan.  Generally 
hostile toward MTibet, MManchuria, and Jennite plainsmen.  Magic of all 
sorts is highly respected.  Generally nature-based religion honoring many 
immortals. 
 
-MJapan (Jiku-Shiru): Humans of Jennite ancestry, with a little Tangor 
blood. Also a native halfling minority.  About 500,000 people?  Several 
martial arts orders have considerable power.  Commerce flows through 
MKorea.  They have plans to subjugate the Tangor Peninsula to exploit it 
for its resources.   
 
-MKorea: Humans, mixed from different cultures into a blend.  Powerful 
Druids.  Engages in fairly heavy trade.  Large merchant class.  Several 
large cities with scattered villages in between. About 350,000 people. 
 
-MEthiopia:  Remnants of Tangor people.  Very isolated.  Surrounded by 
hostile humanoids.  Clerics highly respected, and much religious tolerance. 
Population 200,000.   
 
-MManchuria: Humanoid barbarians: predominantly small groups of ogres or 
gnolls leading huge tribes of kobolds.  Also some humans descended from 
Tangor.  Actively raids MKorea, Chung-Eun, MEthiopia, and MTibet.  Group of 
powerful ogre-magi and human adventurers are trying to organize tribes for 
a mass effort to overrun Chung-Eun and set their leader (an ancient Red 
Dragon, though most of them don't know this) on the throne. 
 
-MMalaysia: Humans who migrated from Chung-Eun.  Loosely organized 
principalities and city-states which will band together in the face of a 
common threat, but usually remain separate, sometimes fighting among 
themselves.  They engage in heavy fishing and agriculture, as well as light 
trade and piracy.  Some people try to unite the land, recognizing its vast 
potential due to its resources.  Pop. 200,000. 
 
-MIndochina:  Humans and elves.  Diverse area of relatively small nations 
and tribes.  Most are faithful followers of Rohindhartha.  Pop.  280,000. 
 
-MThailand:  Humans descended from Jennites.  Ruled as a single united 
kingdom under one dynasty for centuries.  Engages in trade with all its 
neighbors.  Also has a huge underground criminal society, which runs 
casinos and exploits the citizenry.  They also deal in a substance made 
from flowers illegally grown by many peasants:  the plants are closely 
related to Amber Lotus Flowers and the drugs derived from them are very 
potent.  The people are faithful followers of Rohindhartha's Elders' path, 
and most men spend at least a few months of their lives in a monastery with 
shaved heads and yellow robes.  Pop. 450,000. 
 
-MMyanmar:  Humans descended from Jennites.  Loosely allied villages under 
a great king. The commoners rely on subsistence farming or fishing.  Each 
has a giant "Pagoda," or temple dedicated to Rohindhartha.  The people 
follow the Elders' Path, and their clerics and mystics are very highly 
respected.  There are huge gold deposits in parts of the country, and the 
peasants are so dedicated to Rohindhartha that many of the pagodas have 
giant gold domes.  Near the center of the nation is the capital, Pantang, 
the city of a hundred Pagodas.  Pop. 350,000. 
 
-MTibet: Humans, elves, and humanoids.  Sparsely settled land with many 
barbarians, but also many isolated communities of generally-peaceful 
followers of the Greater Path of Rohindhartha.   
 
-MSiberia:  Even more sparsely settled land of humans and humanoid 
barbarians, particularly goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. 
 
-MNepal:  Land of the giants, with every type except sea giants.  They try 
to make others think they are barbarians, but they actually have a fairly 
advanced culture.  This land includes some of the highest mountains in the 
world as well as several active volcanoes.  The giants are generally 
peaceful so long as they are left alone. 
 
-MBhutan (Land  of the Thunder Dragon): Inhabited mainly by humans who are 
subsistence farmers and herders.  The inhabitants are very devout followers 
of Rohindhartha's Greater Path.  Many old dragons who have renounced 
treasure-hunting and instead strive to better themselves reside here, 
including golds, whites, blues, sapphires, rubies, and crystals.  A few 
Cloud and Storm giants reside here as well, and a single Sky Wyrm summoned 
by a Nithian mage centuries ago and unable to find her way home.  The 
monsters work with the people, seeking enlightenment. 
 
-Little Foresty Place:  The secret home of the leprechauns, fairies, 
pixies, ewoks, etc.  which are legendary in the rest of the MOrient.

only a suggestion, please give any suggestions possible to improve them. 
 
Patrick said what's above, the same goes for me.  I think this is all our 
description ideas to date (and some from PWA III), it was getting too 
separate in posts again.  I guess more people than I thought posted stuff, 
but I don't think everyone did.  Maybe it looks like we're about done, *but* 
we still have to wait for some replies & discussion, since at this time this 
may have been made by just a few of us, we have to give everyone their fair 
chance.  Even if we don't all contribute to these, we still need some sort 
of consensus before we can go on. 
 
-notes 
I think we should base the history of the MIndochina peninsula on the 
ancient Khmer Empire.  It looks like in the present much of it would be 
based on the "classical Khmer period".  (just quoting my book on Cambodia 
here, which talks about a lot of SE Asia.) 
We should make various ethnic groups, my ideas are maybe a dominant people 
based on the Han, several major groups of minorities, consisting of 
different tribes.  MZhuang is largest ethnic minority, closely affiliated 
with MHan. 
 
 
The stuff: (Chung-Eun & Jiku-Shiru first, then sort of alphabetical order, 
is that OK?) 
 
-MChina (Chung-Eun):  Humans of Jennite ancestry.  Ruled by an emperor, 
possibly a dragon.  Regional dukes and kings also have power, and compete 
for emperor's favor.  approximately 5 million people?  Great bazaars. 
engages in limited commerce with its southern neighbors, MKorea, and MJapan 
(really MJapan? They're enemies I thought).  Generally hostile toward 
MTibet, MManchuria, and Jennite plainsmen.  Magic of all sorts is highly 
respected.  Generally nature-based religion honoring many immortals (seelie 
court).  Important drake secret society.  traveling bureaucrats (form of the 
mage class) who travel from place to place to advise rulers, have schools 
where they teach their trade.  Dragon Throne is important, powerful 
artifact. Wall in Jennite Sword area, underground wall in east where there 
is war with Jikushiru.  Rohindarthan caves here & there. 
 
-MJapan (Jiku-Shiru): Humans of Jennite ancestry, with a little Tangor 
blood.  Also a native halfling minority (the Hinu).  About 500,000 people? 
Several martial arts orders have considerable power.  Commerce flows through 
MKorea.  They have plans to subjugate the Tangor Peninsula to exploit it for 
its resources.  Figurehead Empress - matriarchal feudal system run by 
Diamyos, who rule shiru, and headed by a Shogun.  Some men are in revolt. 
Maybe some mages with towers here and there, some of whom are also powerful 
in the feudal system.  Several volcanoes. a major religion is nature spirits 
from the earthly to the celestial court, who are called kami (MShinto). 
Several islands (if we agree the old map was an error - I certainly do.) 
 
-MBhutan (Land  of the Thunder Dragon): Inhabited mainly by humans who are 
subsistence farmers and herders.  The inhabitants are very devout followers 
of Rohindhartha's Greater Path.  Many old dragons who have renounced 
treasure-hunting and instead strive to better themselves reside here, 
including golds, whites, blues, sapphires, rubies, and crystals.  A few 
Cloud and Storm giants reside here as well, and a single Sky Wyrm summoned 
by a Nithian mage centuries ago and unable to find her way home.  The 
monsters work with the people, seeking enlightenment.  Rohindarthan/MHindu 
blend. 
 
-Esterhold: various kingdoms (later parts of NACE, maybe we should talk to 
Herve Musseau), Verdan is a primitive fascist state protecting Esterhold 
from "wild" Jennites, and giants, and forcing Jennite slaves to farm (poor 
place for it) and mine abundant minerals.  Some humanoid tribes. 
 
-MEthiopia:  Remnants of Tangor people.  Very isolated.  Surrounded by 
hostile humanoids.  Clerics highly respected, and much religious tolerance. 
Population 200,000.  
 
-Minaean Coast:  These less civilized cousins of the Jennites who settled 
the Great Empire are known to the survivors of Alphatia as fierce pirates. 
Their lands consist of many coastal seaports as well as a dense jungle. 
Southeast Asia would probably be a good model for this culture (maybe a mix 
with Carthage because of Milenian and Tanagoro settlements).  They are long 
time enemies of both Alphatia and the Great Empire. 
National monarchy with local democracies.  Farmers and craftsmen.  Humanoid 
tribes in forest, also halflings called Minaeanns, they live in trees and 
build treehouses (as in Toowin's travels.) 
 
-MIndochina:  Humans and elves.  Diverse area of relatively small nations 
and tribes.  Most are faithful followers of Rohindhartha.  Pop.  280,000. 
 
-Jen: stone-age nomadic tribes of herders, occasionally raid Esterhold, 
Minaea, Chung-Eun, etc..  largely followers of Rathanos. 
 
-MKorea: Humans, mixed from different cultures into a blend.  Powerful 
Druids (MTaoists?).  Engages in fairly heavy trade.  Large merchant class. 
Several large cities with scattered villages in between. About 350,000 
people.  (Chung-Eun outposts along the coast?) 
 
-MMalaysia: Humans who migrated from Chung-Eun.  Loosely organized 
principalities and city-states which will band together in the face of a 
common threat, but usually remain separate, sometimes fighting among 
themselves.  They engage in heavy fishing and slash & burn agriculture, as 
well as light trade and piracy.  Some people try to unite the land, 
recognizing its vast potential due to its resources.  Pop. 200,000.  MMalay 
is largest ethnic group, some MZhuang live here as well.  Is Rohindarthism 
major here? 
 
-MMyanmar:  Humans descended from Jennites.  Loosely allied villages under a 
great king. The commoners rely on subsistence farming or fishing.  Each has 
a giant "Pagoda," or temple dedicated to Rohindhartha.  The people follow 
the Elders' Path, and their clerics and mystics are very highly respected. 
There are huge gold deposits in parts of the country, and the peasants are 
so dedicated to Rohindhartha that many of the pagodas have 
giant gold domes.  Near the center of the nation is the capital, Pantang, 
the city of a hundred Pagodas.  Pop. 350,000. 
 
-MNepal:  Land of the giants, with every type except sea giants.  They try 
to make others think they are barbarians, but they actually have a fairly 
advanced culture.  This land includes some of the highest mountains in the 
world as well as several active volcanoes.  The giants are generally 
peaceful so long as they are left alone.  Rohindarthan/MHindu blend. 
 
-NW Forest (Northern): The secret home of the leprechauns, fairies, pixies, 
(oriental spirit folk), ewoks (and/or katoz,) from outer space, etc., which 
are legendary in the rest of the MOrient. 
 
-NW Forest (Southern): Giants hostile to Alphatia and Esterhold, developed 
"close" civilization.  Either one large nation, or rival ones of various 
races (I prefer the latter, for variety, even developed giants are still 
going to fight - and we could throw in some new types of giants.) 
 
-MSiberia:  Even more sparsely settled land of humans and humanoid 
barbarians, particularly goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, 
MInuits/MSiberians.  Quarik city too. 
 
-MThailand:  Humans descended from Jennites.  Ruled as a single united 
kingdom under one dynasty for centuries.  Slash & burn farming in various 
styles.  Engages in trade with all its neighbors.  Also has a huge 
underground criminal society, which runs casinos and exploits the citizenry. 
They also deal in a substance made from flowers illegally grown by many 
peasants:  the plants are closely related to Amber Lotus Flowers and the 
drugs derived from them are very potent.  The people are faithful followers 
of Rohindhartha's Elders' path, and most men spend at least a few months of 
their lives in a monastery with shaved heads and yellow robes.  Pop. 
450,000.  The MHmong/MMiao here were forced south by the MHan, a few are 
refugees in secluded places. Distinguish themselves with names like Black 
Miao (Miao is after them all), White , Red, Blue, Flowery, and Cowrie shell 
(note - these names are Earth examples, we need our own).  
 
-Thonia:  This region is settled by people of Antalian ancestry and has a 
culture similar to that of the Heldanners (previously the suggestion was 
they had Blackmoor tech and it was voted down, but barbarism was suggested 
instead.  Do we still want it without Blackmoor technology at least?) 
 
-MTibet: Humans, elves, and humanoids.  Sparsely settled land with many 
barbarians, but also many isolated communities of generally-peaceful 
followers of the Greater Path of Rohindhartha (many mystics? a little Ka, 
Ixion, Hel)  They're herders (but many don't slaughter their animals) and 
farmers.  Mainly Nentsun plateau, barricaded by various winding river 
canyons to the south, and mountains around the rest.

This is a GREAT idea!  It would mean either extending MKorea or placing 
little outposts along the coast in opportune spots.  After all, even with 
this awesome current, the voyage should still take at least a week, 
especially when you consider that they can only travel about 10 hours a 
day.  This should also include some sort of powerful magic, perhaps 
including artifacts from the spheres of time (water) and thought (wind).  I 
know very little about Korea, but would it work if it was dominated by 
Druids who help move the current along?    This would also mean that 
Chung-Eun and Jiku-Shiru would have to have very skilled shipwrights.   
Has anyone seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?  There's  a great 
scene in there where the group is riding in a boat going terribly fast down 
a dark, narrow tunnel with Willy Wonka acting freaky.  I just had a vision 
of the journey into the night being something akin to this. 
Speaking of which, which way should night be?   I guess I would have to say 
that the journey from Zyxl to Tangor Bay should probably be during the 
night, since Jiku-Shiru would logically have had some contact with the 
outside.  Foreigners would see that the current is not navigable up the 
Skothar coast (at least during the day when they look) and would then 
usually turn back or go southwest to Davania.

Chung-Eun New Year 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Anyway, given that the Chinese New Year is coming up, I was wondering if  
anyone had any ideas about MChina's equivalent.  I would propose, given the  
approximate date of the real world Chinese New Year, that MChina's New 
Year begin on Vatermont 1 -- the second month of the Thyatian calendar. 
We could probably use the Chinese month names, adjusted as necessary  
for the actual Mystaran seasons.  For the year names, we could make 
appropriate substitutions of mythological monsters for animals -- for 
example, the Mystaran counterpart to the upcoming Year of the Ox could  
be the Year of the Gorgon. 
 
Also, could somebody give the rest of us a quick run-down of how the Chinese 
New Year is typically celebrated?  I recall seeing scenes of parades through 
Chinatown, but I know practically nothing else of what is involved in the  
celebrations.   
 
Finally, what are some of the other major Chinese holidays that could be 
translated into MChina? 
 
David Melik 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Just a note, this is very long.  I got carried away a little. 
 
Chinese month names are quite simple, First Moon, Second Moon, etc. 
It would probably more appropriate to push back the Chinese New 
Year a little bit, as it is supposed to be near spring (I think it 
suppose to be in the mid point between winter and spring solstice, 
but don't quote me on that).  The actual name for Chinese New Year 
is the Spring Festival.  So it might be better to place it at 
Vatermont 14 or Thaumont 1.  I don't have any reference ready, but 
how does Mystrian moon cycle works.  Based on Chinese lunar calendar 
each month is 29 or 30 days with full moon at the 15th and new moon 
at the 1st.  Every several year a leap month is added sometime  
during the year to even off the calendar.  In Chinese lunar Calendar 
the first three month is the spring, next three the summer, etc. 
 
The celebration for CNY starts at December, where family salts and cures 
meats (December is also called the "cure month").  The Chinese view 
of CNY is somewhat similar to American on Thanksgiving where the 
family suppose to be together.  On NY's eve the tradition is to stay 
awake past the midnight.  On NY's day people go around visiting friends 
and family to wishing happy new year.  Elders give children money 
inside red envelops.  The traditional food include dumplings, year 
cake (a sticky rice cake which is either cook as a dish or in a soup 
or made sweet as a desert, the cured meats, sausages, and fish.  The 
fish is important because of a pun.  In place where fish is rare, 
people sometimes use a wooden substitution just for the show. 
Lots o' fireworks, lion dance, dragon dance and stuff.  People  
generally wear new cloth at this day.  Another tradition is write 
the word "spring" on a piece of red paper (red is a color of joy in 
China) and stick it up side down on the door, another pun symbolize 
the coming of spring.  On the both sides  of front door a 
a special 2 line poem is also written on red paper and posted up, 
generally with something on the top of the door that goes with it. 
There are probably quite a bit more stuff, but this is all I can 
think of at the top of my head right now.  Oh, gambling is quite 
common on NYD and children is often allow to drink a little bit. 
The celebration generally continual for another couple of days. 
On third day of Jan, the wives visit their own family, and  
people generally go back to work on the 4th of Jan.  But the 
official end of CNY celebration comes at the 15th of Jan., the 
Lantern Festival, where people walk around the street carrying 
a lantern.  The city also held a lantern show along with the  
rich families.  The rich family also held riddle competition 
and give out prizes for people answers the riddles correctly. 
The food to eat on this day is a small round rice cake ball 
, sometime with sweet stuffing inside, in a sweet soup.  The 
ball symbolize the wholeness and the completeness of the family. 
Oh every household is suppose to have a kitchen god watch over 
them, and on Jan 2nd he is going back to heaven and report to 
the Celestial Emperor about the past year of the family.  So 
some family put up the painting of the kitchen god and smear 
some sweet rice cake on the mouth to "sweet" up his report :). 
 
There are 3 major holiday during the year.  First is the CNY/Spring 
Festival.  The second on May 5th is called the "Righteous Noon" (the 
best translation I can think of) or more commonly known now as the 
Dragon Boat Festival.  As the mid summer is approaching, people on 
this day take steps to protect themselves from the summers epidemics. 
Sulfur wine is drink to drive out the poison in the body.  Red 
runes written on yellow paper is stuck on various places of the 
house to prevent the entering of evil sprites.  The sulfur wine 
is greatly disliked by creature and sprites, and can force them 
turn back to their true form if they were in human form.  Later 
this holiday took on some more meaning to mourn the death of a 
patriot poet.  He jumped into a lake after his proposal to improve 
the nation was rejected by the emperor and got himself exiled. 
The people row out the lake try to rescue him, and failing that 
throw rice wrapped in bamboo leaves into the lake to feed the 
fish so they will not eat the body of the poet.  This starts the 
tradition of the dragon boat race (where teams from different  
organization, county, etc. race a small long boat with a head 
of dragon carved in front).   And eat rice wrapped in bamboo 
leaves.  The third major holiday is the Mid-Autumn, which is on 
the 15th of Aug.  This is the day there suppose to have the 
brightest full moon.  Basically this is a day that people takes 
a break after the fall harvest.  The people watch the moon,  
eat moon cake(a round sweet cake).  There are another story 
associate with this day which I will tell if people are interested. 
 
Beside the three major holidays, there are a bunch of minor ones. 
Some I can think of are the Clear moon/Ghost day, which is on 
15 of July.  July is believed where the gate to underworld is open 
and ghost can walk on earth.  On this month people is generally 
careful what they doing so they won't have an accident and 
became a substitute for one of the "good brothers" But on Clear 
Moon people will go to the grave of their ancestor and held 
a small ceremony there.  There are also minor holidays on  
Sept. 9th and Dec. 8th, but nothing too interesting happen 
there.  Birthday and Accension day of some popular gods are 
also celebrated big time depend on region.  Sorry this post 
is so long.  Hopefully people find it useful.  If people 
want more detail on any more of the stuff, feel free to ask.

  I think this idea has a lot of merit.  TSR always did try to make their 
places match up with real-world equivalencies, and this is a great example 
of a way to do it.  We should also consider that the YEAR for MChina 
should be considerably later than the Thyatian year -- for example, 
we're sitting at 1997 and I think that the current Chinese Calendar is 
somewhere in the 3400's or so.

  Do you really think we have to make the MChina "Years" mythological? 
The Northland's Gaz presents the Norse Rune System with meanings very 
close to their "real" meanings (with a few modifications).  What's wrong 
with having Cats, Monkeys, Dogs, Oxen and Horses?  Perhaps we could 
just modify a few -- based on what each real animal year represents 
we could pick a few where a mythological creature would fit into the 
same role.

  I don't know off hand, but my Mother teaches English as A Second language 
and about half her students are Chinese, so she is very familiar with a 
lot of their traditional celebrations.  I'll put out some feelers and see 
what I can come up with. 
 
  (To be honest, I'm finding the idea of figuring out the calendar and 
related holidays to be quite appealing.  I would definitely be interested 
in working in this area of development, as well as working on the  
development of Oriental Style Dragon's)

Chinese don't really count year like that.  The common way to count 
year is by either the start of the dynasty or by years the emperor 
has been sitting on the throne.   For example the 45th year 
of Tang, or the 32nd year of emperor Chian-Loon.  But this might 
be difficult to do for us, as we need to have a pretty detailed  
MChina history to actually use that.

Umm, no cats.  The twelve animals are in order, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, 
dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, chicken, dog, pig.  There are also 
a story go with the ordering (I guess Chinese really like stories), but 
basically those animal compete in a race and that was how they ended up. 
I would like to modify it so it would be different in the game world. 
 
And a little more about Chinese Calendar.  The calendar is actually 
in a 60 year cycle.  The name of each year is a combine of 1 of the 
ten "sky stems" and 1 of 12 "earth branches."  Each year both part 
counts forward by one.  The 12 earth branches are commonly associated 
with the 12 animal but they have more official names.  Each 2 of the 
sky stems is given an elemental association.  In Chinese belief,  
there are 5 elements, Gold/Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.  I will 
suggest we fudge it a bit and say Wood is equal to the Elemental 
Air (as the branch of the tree is extended towards the air :), and 
Gold to be Prime.  Anyway back to the years, so each year is  
associated with an element and an animal, such as Fire Horse,  
Wood Ox, Gold Goat, etc. and are commonly referred that way in riddles, 
prophesies, etc.  Chinese day is divided in 12 periods, each 2 hours 
long.  Each period use the name of the earth branches.  The first 
period starts at 1am, so that is when a Chinese day starts officially. 
And might be fun to use it to cause some confusion to PCs not  
knowing that as when Chinese refer to midnight it would actually 
be 1.  Each period is further break down into 4 segments.  Animals 
are not used to refer to periods of a day, but we can use it just 
to keep things simple.

Timelines 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Here's a very rough timeline.  Once again, it's only my suggestion, and I'm 
not even very sure of it. 
 
BC 
1900- Jennites begin moving out of the plains, colonizing area around Tangor  
	Bay.   
1200- First emperor of Chung-Eun crowned.   
1100- Hinu reach Zyxl. Refugees arrive in MSiberia from Sindh, bringing with  
	them worship of Rohindhartha. 
1000- Alphatian Landfall 
850- Emperor of Chung-Eun begins to follow Rohindhartha, encourages trade with  
	the outside world. 
750- Jennite plainsmen sweep over Chung-Eun and place their Khan on the throne. 
       Refugees from Chung-Eun found MMalaysia and Jiku-Shiru. 
600- Jennites have been absorbed into Chung-Eun's culture; they once again war  
	with the plainsmen. 
500- Chung-Eun's contact with Alphatia is disastrous, they withdraw within their  
	borders and begin extreme isolationism. 
450- Great Wall (whatever it is) is constructed to keep out the Jennites. 
350- Isolationism is less extreme, MKorea founded. 
350-present- Chung-Eun undergoes many changes in power, with plainsmen and 
	between East and West China (the Mystaran equivalents of North and South 
	China), but the nation remains mostly unchanged. 
AC 
0- first king of MThailand crowned.   
Present- Is it 1000, 1010, 1013, what?  My own opinion would be to begin at 
1000 and describe the events since then. 
 
This obviously leaves huge gaps of time to stick anything we want in.  We 
could also push many of the events further ahead.  Please let me know what 
you think:) 
 
Patrick 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
  I haven't gone thought this in detail yet, but I was thinking that 
when it comes to our timeline of event we might want to check things out 
with Daniel Debois, who isn't on the MOrient "Committee", but who has 
made an excellent compilation of all the existing Gazetteer Timeline 
information (at least I think it was Daniel).  These time lines are 
available from the Mystaral-l mailing list, but I was thinking that he 
would be intimately familiar with them, having put them together, and 
might be able to help us fix certain events in time in a tidy way.  We 
obviously want to choose a timeline that will mesh in as well as possible 
with existing data. 
 
  This is, of course, just a suggestion.  Does anyone else think it is 
worth while?  I know that I it is difficult for me to tell if a proposed 
timeline of events fits in well with existing TSR events, but perhaps 
more of you are familiar with the necessary information.  Anyway, I'd 
also like to say that I'm willing to volunteer for the job of contacting 
Daniel with our proposed timeline information and asking him if he'd be 
interested in helping in this small way.

Religion/Philosophy 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MOrient Gang: 
 
  Somebody was talking about the Confucianism, Shintoism, and various other  
local Asian "religions".  I don't know a /lot/ about these, but what I 
do know is that they aren't so much /religions/ as /philosophies/.  In  
particular, I seem to recall that they are not necessarily associated 
with a particular "god".  Perhaps these would be better served by special 
Mystic orders.  
 
  If we did make them "religions" then we would have to explain where/how  
the Clerics of these religions received their spell compliments (which, 
I believe, are usually made available by the Immortal under worship.) 
 
  If we made the Mystic orders, we could also try developing subtly  
different forms of Mystic hand fighting for each group.  As a real world 
example, Taoist Tai Chi is an "Exercise" that was developed from a Taoist form  
of Martial Arts (in fact, it essentially consists of fighting  
moves done in a known pattern and in slow motion).  Most Official Gazetteers 
take basic, "Cyclopedia" player character rules and develop them in new 
and different ways (like the Rangers in Thyatis, the Merchants in Darokin, 
or the Merchant Princes in Minrothad).  This could be one area where 
we could do the same.

This is an excellent point.  I think mystics should play a major role in 
these religions.  We could also do something like TSR did for the Churches 
of Karameikos and Traladara, with no specific immortals, but rather the 
philosophy providing spells.  Something like AD&D priests who receive 
spells from their alignment.  We don't need to have clerics for these 
philosophies, of course, but if we had an MConfucius somewhere in history, 
he at least would probably have become an immortal.  Also, clerics don't 
necessarily have to "worship" their immortals.  Buddhists, for example, do 
not worship any gods, but we have at least tentatively agreed on the 
immortal Rohindhartha.  Maybe MOriental immortals can act more as guides 
than gods.

Yes, that's a good idea.  I'd like to do also something with prana/chi, and 
new ways of magic.  Perhaps we could make the mystic more of an "open" 
class, if you know what I mean.  Maybe all mystics have one thing in common, 
like skill/power slots and/or prana/chi slots(like spell slots)/points, and 
beyond this, what they learn to do depends on what philosophy they follow 
and what their interests and way of life are.  Of course, we'd need to make 
general stats for different ones, for the DM's use and maybe to guide the 
player.  However, there can also be mystics not connected to any particular 
school. People on earth learn many martial arts and even earn black belts in 
more than one...  Whose to say we can't have a generic mystic just like a 
generic mage.  The only difference is mages have a wide range of choices. 
Perhaps we could take all the abilities from D&D mystics and the various 
AD&Dx monks, and pool them, add to them, make a system for them.  The mystic 
and the monk are cool, and deserve a better treatment than they get, which I 
think sucks compared to how mages, other classes are so developed.  They 
don't need to be a sub-class.  They're different enough to be their own. 
Well, I'm sure you know what I'm saying, and I'll stop going off on a 
tangent.  Yes, we should do the same thing, and MOrient is the perfect place 
to do this.

Elves on Skothar 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
About the topic of elves on Skothar, I think you have two possible explanations: 
1. they are descendants of the e'aar, the winged elves (Skothar is not that 
far from Immortals' Arm, if geography is not an opinion and Mystara is not 
flat). I don't know if you planned the elves to be winged ones, but this is 
the first hypothesis, members of an expedition party to find a long lost 
artifact or something else that lost contact with the e'aar fatherland and 
decided to settle in Skothar 
2. they are descendants of the sylvan elves (elves from the Sylvan Realm), 
that fled across the sea instead of using Mealiden's Rainbow Path when the 
forces of Moorkroft overthrew the realm. Other possibility is that they fled 
from the Sylvan Realm because their leader did not get along with Ilsundal 
and so his clan moved to another region (across the sea) to find the lost 
brethren who had settled near Blackmoor or for other reasons. 
3. elves coming from another dimension or reality or plane. In this case on 
Skothar (as opposite to the rest of Mystara), elves and humans could breed 
the fabled half-elves, that cannot be breed normally by Mystaran elves and 
Mystaran humans (according to Gaz5) 
 
these are my hypothesis, feel free to reply me personally at 
dalmonte@dsc.unibo.it

They could very easily be an earlier migration, from Vulcania, that ended  
up in Skothar. There are literally any number of points at which the  
elves could have ended up in Skothar. 
 
Another suggestion might be that the elves of Skothar are somehow related  
to the N'djatwa- the elf/ogres of Davania. They seem rather oriental in  
flavor, and might blend in well in the MOrient.

They do resemble Ogre Magi, don't they? 
 
Another idea to consider -- Haldemar negotiated an alliance between 
N'djatwa and Alphatia.  Skotharians in general seem to dislike 
Alphatians.  So any race that would ally with them must be an 
evil race, right?  Of course, the fact that they actually are cannibals 
gives that idea some weight.

Martial Arts 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
I don't know if you posted these or not, but I'd be interested in seeing 
them.  I'm working on a martial art styles thing too.  I think it was the 
mystic rules in the old Masters set I was reading, which said that fighting 
styles correspond to elements, and I thought it would be interesting to 
assign actual martial arts to these different elements.  I made combinations 
of the elements so there could be more styles.  (Then after reading WoTI I 
did sphere and class combos too, since I eventually used class combos in 
OD&D.) First I looked in the Manual of the Planes, but it had negative and 
positive planes, which I don't use, and it didn't combine them all, so I 
made my own.  Thinking back to the RC planes chapter, AFAIK the elemental 
planes aren't touching each other, but if they were, these new elements could 
be the spaces between them, or other planes between them, but they wouldn't 
even have to be planes.  I think they really need some improvement, so 
that's also why I've posted them. Any ideas?  Oh yeah, the charts don't 
exactly line up with the others, it's in alphabetical order, so if you want 
to find out the right elements on the other charts it'd have to be looked 
up.  Anyway, here's the charts.  
 
Elements 
        Air     Earth   Fire    Water 
Air     Air     Dust    Smoke   Water 
Earth   Dust    Earth   Magma   Ooze 
Fire    Smoke   Magma   Fire    Steam 
Water   Vapor   Ooze    Steam   Water 
Void (corresponds to entropy.  some ancient civilizations did consider it an 
element.) 
 
Martial Art Styles (this *really needs improvement and additions - *WARNING* 
I know this is *not accurate* since I don't know much about this... it's 
just thoughts & ideas.  also maybe we should substitute the 4 basic types 
with actual styles) 
 
                Defensive       Offensive       Throws          Wrestling 
Defensive       Defensive       Ninjitsu        Jujitsu                  
Offensive       Ninjitsu        Offensive                       Sumo      
Throws                                          Wrestling                 
Wrestling                                                       Throws 
street fighting (corresponds to entropy, since it seems they'd use any method 
to kill...)  
 
Classes (OK - so they're more like titles, so what.) 
        Cleric          Mage           Rogue   Warrior 
Cleric  Cleric          Theurgist      Mystic  Paladin 
Mage    Theurgist       Mage           Bard    Ranger 
Rogue   Mystic          Bard           Rogue   Thug 
Warrior Paladin         Ranger         Thug    Warrior 
Ultimist (a combo of everything (from Polyhedron mag.) which is too munchkin 
so, they're bad, so they're entropic.  Seriously though, a highly toned-down 
version of this could be interesting)  
 
THEurgist is as in THEology, I thought of it myself but then read somewhere 
theurgist is an actual word.  Anyone know what the definition is and what it 
would be for rpg's?  You could substitute Forester for Ranger, but I like 
ranger from the roguelike computer game Moria.  I use the Mystic class as 
is, but I guess if it went on the chart that's where it would go.  I guess 
monk would work too.  Thug is aka headsman, the monster from the RC.  Seems 
appropriate for that class.  A friend of mine also suggested bandit or brigand. 
 
Now... the spheres.  I don't think I'd actually use extra ones, but I think 
this is just something that's maybe useful to look at, when thinking about 
immortals, quests for immortality, (maybe even with transferring AD&D cleric 
spell spheres to OD&D spheres?) etc.  Maybe it's not useful but here it is 
anyway.  Actually it did help me when I made immortals for Daneme, my own 
world, even though I only used the 5 spheres. 
 
        Energy  Matter          Thought         Time 
Energy  Energy  War             Magic           Power 
Matter  War     Matter          Creativity      Change 
Thought Magic   Creativity      Thought         Wisdom 
Time    Power   Change          Wisdom          Time 
 
I think I did one for colors corresponding to elements too, but that's more 
complicated, and I'd have to figure out how it goes again even though it's 
written down, and I have an essay to do, and maybe that would be getting too 
far off the Mystara subject so that's definitely enough for now.

MEthiopia 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Here's some notes I took directly from Dragon #200.  It's sentence fragments 
and may have typos, since it was time-consuming to record even this way, so 
I hope we have some discussion on this eventually.  It looks like we could 
use these for MEthiopia, with some research, discussion, & modifications.  I 
know we may not be doing the area for a while, but I'm sending my issue to a 
friend, as I'm done with it, so I wanted to get this out there so we can 
throw it around.   
I think maybe we should also base MEthiopia  on that ancient African 
civilization on earth that was in roughly the same area if I'm correct.  I 
don't mean Egypt.  It's a major one that is included in history books along 
with the other "cradles of civilization", so there might be more information 
on it than Ethiopia. 
 
source: "Magic from the Gods", by Michael John Wybo II, in Dragin Magazine #200. 
 
Baule Diviner 
	advisors to the city dwellers of MEthiopia.  read omens revealed through 
the elements (spheres? since the article says African magic is possible by 
the will of the gods... or more malign creatures) by the immortal of fate. 
dress in red sleeveless wraps and shave their heads.  wear gold bangles & 
neck rings. worship fate, do not seek to change her will.  advise their patrons  
on how they have incurred fate's (dis)pleasure, seldom tell future except in  
vague riddles or analogies. 
	 
skills required: astrology, astronomy, observation;  
 
skills recommended: dagger staff, animal lore, direction sense, tracking,  
weather sense 
	 
spells: greater divination, elemental clerical benefits:+1 reaction in city due  
to respect for their wisdom 
 
Bokor(Sorcerer) 
	 
evil sorcerer who uses dangerous magic without aid of gods wisdom (or maybe 
from entropic imms) source of learning and power are Orish-Nla, evil 
denizens of underworld. unpredictable and despised magic.  hunted by 
countrymen because they fear the wrath of the Zande, whose purpose is to 
destroy Bokor.  homeless wanderers who study their art for power. 
	 
required skills: spellcraft, recommended skills: spear, dagger, bow, 
alertness, cooking, direction sense, fire building, hunting, endurance, 
tracking, set snares. 
	 
spells: wild mages, no elemental spells, they despise Bokor (again this 
points to spheres.) chaos clerical sphere (entropy?) 
	 
benefits: D6 HD 
	 
hindrances: imms despise Bokor so they suffer disadvantages.  1. curse 
which changes daily, each Bokor rolls on a table that includes Bokor's true 
form and level+1 random forms.  still may cast spells, the rest like 
polymorph spell.  2. death has refused Bokor entry to realm of dead, they 
become undead, type depends on level, but 12+ he becomes an Orish-Nla 
(resembles shadow fiend), spell abilities according to undead type. 
polymorph still in effect after death, still retains true form abilities, 
but the forms are undead too. constantly haunted by Zande with women, if true  
profession is known, -2 reaction. 
 
Houngan 
	worshippers of masculine side of spirit world, the animus (Zug or Zul on 
Mystara is my educated guess, since MEthiopia could have the Afridhi or 
whatever people) concerned with lore and appeasement of spirit world. 
appease angry, hostile, aggressive, destructive, etc., natures of spirits. 
will promote a war if spirit wants it, or unavoidable, or for own purposes, 
when they'd convince people spirits willed it. (depends on align.)  some 
protect communities from spirits, others use position to further personal 
standing at expense of community, who often put up with it since it's their 
only protection from spirits. 
	 
skills recommended: spear, club, mace, bowyer/fletcher, endurance, 
weaponsmithing. 
	 
spells: magely and priestly necromancy, (maybe AD&D shamanism? I wouldn't 
know. anyone have the supplement?  We could use it if spirits are important 
in this culture.  For Mystara I'd rather keep the OD&D definition of Shaman, 
it's the info that counts.) 
	 
benefits: (for AD&D may use warrior group proficiencies without spending 
extra slots, IMO "groups" is a lame unrealistic rule.  if you want to learn 
something and have the time, IQ, teacher or other method, you probably learn 
it, dang it.  should we stick to OD&D skills, but translate AD&D ones?) 
	 
hindrances: must sacrifice "value" of one large domestic animal to spirits 
per level each time they increase a level. 
 
Mambo 
	female equiv. of houngan.  worship feminine side of spirit world (anima, 
Zug or Zul in Mystara) also concerned w/lore & appeasement.  draw on 
compromising, persuasive, healing, but often deceitful aspect of spirits to 
protect community or for own ends.  wise women of community.  would rather 
council diplomacy or guile than war.  calming influence on hot-blooded 
community members. 
 
recommended skills: dagger, staff, sling, artistic ability, cooking, 
dancing, musical instrument, weaving, singing, spells & hindrances: as per  
houngan 
 
benefits: can charm up to 1/2 her level in HD of males per day (as charm 
person) must be one at a time, each target must have 8+ INT for it to work. 
takes a turn per attempt. 
 
Zande 
	fearsome, teeth & lips dyed red w/berry juice.  called by gods to seek & 
punish heresy, especially Bokor, whom they hunt down & kill.  can be 
extremely harsh in punishment of villages & individuals who harbor them, 
even unknowingly.  common in lands of pygmies of central African jungles. 
often accompanied by male warriors who slay Bokor's undead form after Zande 
kills mortal form (possibly Benin hunters from Dragon #195 "Real Warriors 
Ride Elephants!" article, in which case "Species foe" as per ranger ability, 
is undead.)  Often as hated as Bokor they hunt, but populace fears them 
enough to cooperate out of fear of retribution.  many witches have been 
slain by villagers angry for crop destruction from cure though.  Sometimes 
use power & fear to further their own selfish & ambitious ends.  harbingers 
of "justice" and vengeance (infernal lawful imposed order IMO).  Zande 
always female, and as I thought, must be lawful (but may be good, neutral or 
evil.) 
 
skills required: short sword, herbalism, recommended: spear, bow, sling, 
cooking, brewing, healing, intimidation, observation. 
 
spells: enchantment school, also clerical combat sphere. 
 
benefits: can cast curse on Bokor or other heretics, and those who give 
them succor.  heretics include foreign spellcasters/priests.  can include 
crop withering, or /sign of interdiction/, which is specialized /wizard 
mark/ that is visible, cannot be removed even with dispel magic (which 
should be debatable.) it shows the wearer is a heretic )-2 to reaction) 
always allowed saving throw vs. death magic to avoid curse.  may bond 
w/warrior companions, can be done once in witch's lifetime. allows 2-way 
empathy, clair-everything once a day 1D10 turns, ability for witch to lay 
compulsion on warrior 1/day w/no save as per suggestion spell.  warrior gets 
1 more hp/lev & +2/hit & dmg when defending bond-mate.  both must be willing 
participants, once formed it's never broken.  if warrior dies, witch suffers 
as per a death of familiar.  if either is wounded while sense-link is on, 
both suffer damage, both save vs. paralysis or link is broken.  can be 
broken by mutual assent.  can't begin again for 24 hours. (that math doesn't 
sound quite right...) 
 
hindrances: generate lots of respect, +1 to all "positive reactions", also fear  
and "negative reactions" have a -1 penalty (is this some weird AD&D2, I thought  
there's just plain reactions.) 
 
BTW there's some art in the article too, so if we want to use this and 
anyone else has dragon #200, if you photocopy me the art I could make a

Jikushiru and Emperor Dragons 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The message has been sent - sorry for forgetting about it for so long.  
:-)  As far as groups go, I'd definitely like to volunteer to be in the 
Jikushiru group - I know a fair bit about China, but more about Japan, and 
most of my ideas are forming around Jikushiru anyway.  It does occur to 
me, though, that we'll still need to coordinate things between groups, 
especially the events concerning both - for instance, the proposed defeat 
of the Emperor of Chung-Eun by the First Empress, Himiko, requires there 
to be a reason for the Emperor to invade Jikushiru in his true Dragon 
form, and that the event be the end of his 'dynasty.' But we'll cross that 
bridge when we come to it, hopefully.  
 
Just to get in an obligatory bit of original content, I'd like to get some 
opinions on just what period or equivalent people think Jikushiru should 
be in as of the 'current' time.  I personally think it would be most 
interesting to have a state not quite analogous to any in Japan's history, 
but close, with appropriate legendary/historical resonances. 
Specifically... 
 
For quite some time now, perhaps generations, the Empress has been little 
more than a figurehead sovereign.  Politics in the court and between the 
great families of the land have reduced her power to nearly nothing - she 
still has her ceremonial duties, and her duties as the official head of 
the MShinto religion, and furthermore some of the nobles still pay 
courteous respect to her opinions, but by and large the days of great 
Imperial power are past.  For quite some time now, the daimyos - heads of 
households, with armies of samurai and other warriors at their command - 
have feuded among themselves for land, power, wealth, or honor.  While one 
might not exactly call Jikushiru a war-ravaged land, it has had its 
difficulties, to be sure.  
 
But now, one of the daimyos, with the Empress's blessing, has managed to 
unite most of them under her rule, with the title of shogun.  (The word 
means, roughly, general, or commander of the army.  The full title was 
originally 'Seii Taishogun,' or 'Barbarian-Suppressing High General,' 
referring to the office's original duties of suppressing Hinu unrest in 
the north.)  Technically, the shogun rules only as a delegate of the 
Empress - holding only whatever powers she chooses to grant - but in 
practice, the Empress has granted rather broad powers, and it is expected 
that it would be difficult for her to deny a request of the shogun.  
 
Fortunately, the shogun is a wise and just woman.  She has worked only for 
the greater good of Jikushiru, and has been more than fair to the just 
daimyos, while showing the greedy, aggressive, and corrupt ones no mercy. 
The arts have flourished under her reign, as has a certain amount of trade 
and interaction with foreign cultures. 
 
The problem is that the shogun is dying.  She has perhaps a few years left 
in her yet, perhaps less - but all the efforts of the best MShinto priests 
and priests of Rohindartha have been to no avail in curing her illness. 
And the likely successors to the shogunate look far from as promising as 
she was - a strict, insular isolationist willing to let the daimyos fight 
among themselves in the name of tradition, an aggressive expansionist who 
wants to smash the last resisting daimyos and provinces, then lead 
Jikushiru on a war of conquest into MManchuria, MKorea, and perhaps even 
beyond, and a few others who would be more likely to let the shogunate 
collapse completely than sustain it.  Jikushiru is currently a dynamic, 
growing, exciting place to live... but its fate is shrouded in haze... 
 
Any comments or further ideas?  Any fellow developers interested in 
becoming Jikushiru specialists?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
First, I just had to chime in and say that I think that David's and Scott's  
ideas using 'shiru' as the original hinu's word meaning "Shire" is inspired.   
I also really liked Scott's 'mini-history' for Jikushiru.  Lets go with it! 
 
  Second, I've been giving some thought to the idea of "Oriental Dragons", 
who would, of course, be the type of dragons which rule Chung-Eun.  In 
doing so, I've re-read the Dragon entries in the Cyclopedia.  If the "Oriental  
Dragons" are a splinter-species of real dragons, then in order for the Emperor  
to appear to be human, he would have to be old enough and powerful enough to  
(a) be magic casters and (b) be able to cast Polymorph Self.  This is a fourth 
level spell.   Also, who ever is the "heir apparent" would also have to be in  
a high enough age bracket and have been given the Polymorph Self spell  
(probably given to them by the reining Emperor).  This isn't necessarily a 
problem, but it is a special consideration to keep in mind. 
 
  Another idea I had was that the "Oriental Dragons" are actually another 
variety of Drake, so I plan to look over the Drake entry in "Tales of The Wee  
Folk" (PC1 I think) as soon as I can visit my friend who owns it.  I see 
some positive things associated with this idea: 
 
1) Drakes can automatically take the shape of a particular humanoid form,  
so there is no requirement in knowing 4th level spells. 
2) In light of our discussions to use the Fairy Court as a "Celestial Court", 
Drakes as Emperors would seem to fit in well.  (Wasn't the Chinese Emperor 
considered a Living God?) 
 
  One disadvantage is that (I think) Drakes are considerably smaller than 
normal-sized dragons, which would make the claim that the Emperor is a 
/Dragon/ seem a bit far-fetched.... 
 
  The third Idea I had was to create a special type of creature which is 
very similar to a Dragon, but has the natural ability to polymorph, either  
into anything or into one form.  Many adjustments would have to be made to  
ensure that this new "pseudo" dragon type wasn't too powerful -- giving a  
polymorph ability to a true dragon without reducing some of its other  
regular powers has the potential to severely unbalance the game.  This new 
creature could be similar enough that the belief that the Emperor /is/ a  
dragon would be reasonable, but different enough that they aren't nearly  
as powerful as a "true" dragon of the same size/age/whatever (though they  
should still be more powerful than regular humans and most adventurers). 
 
  Since the "Dragon as Emperor" idea is such a strong one with us, I think 
this needs to be considered more seriously.  Comments?

True, but I think it rather helps if the Emperor has to be one of the 
older, more powerful dragons.  You wouldn't want just any hatchling on the 
Dragon Throne, after all.  And also, I expect that, if we simply make the 
restriction, as has been suggested, that no human may sit upon the Dragon 
Throne, then we could see any number of rulers for shorter times - I'd 
expect a few drakes and perhaps shapeshifted magic animals taking the 
throne for certain dynasties.  I'm partial to the idea of a humanoid 
invasion from the steppes actually sweeping through Chung-Eun and putting 
one of their own on the throne, a gnoll perhaps.  If this seems 
far-fetched, remember that Ghengis Khan did much the same, and it was in 
fact Khublai Khan's palace, which he ruled China from, that inspired 
Coleridge's poem "Xanadu.."

Some Loose Ends 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Several things have come up regarding my map of Skothar that I think the 
entire group should discuss: 
1) We still have not yet reached a consensus on the location of Chung-Eun. 
I placed what I felt was a good location on the map and gave my reasons for 
it, but if the group decides, we can certainly move it. 
2) Are we making a new MIndia on Skothar or not?   
3) We MUST decide why the outside world has not heard of the MOrient before. 
IMO, it should be a number of factors: Minaean Pirates, barbarians on all 
sides, and some sort of underwater culture (or cultures) should thrive in 
the waters from the Gulf of Tangor to around where I located MKorea.  They 
might allow ships of the Oriental nations to sail through, but they should 
demand some sort of tribute for this passage, and they should attack foreign 
ships or those that won't pay immediately. 
4) There are two forested areas near the Bay of Thorin in Northwest Skothar. 
Should there be some sort of culture established there?  The migration map 
shows an Oltec colony south of this area in 3,000 BC and Jennites who began 
moving that direction in 1,900 BC, but since this area is so different from 
the Steppes where the Jennites thrive, maybe it has evolved its own unique 
culture. 
 
I think these four questions should be addressed, we should finalize a basic 
map, and we should agree on basic nation descriptions before we begin to 
break up into smaller groups:)

        Hrm, I don't think that was part of the original idea. But if the  
that's what people would like to do, although I think it would be rather 
redundant....

        I'd go for cultural factors rather than underwater creatures...

I agree with this.

Exactly.  When I wrote that, I was thinking about mentioning the Eastern US 
or California as examples, but I decided it would just make the post longer 
and more confusing.

Well, its been a while since I've seen any new ideas, so:

>>it, but if the group decides, we can certainly move it.

>I totally agree with Patrick. I like how he placed the nations on his map 
>--Gabriele Ferri 
 
>I think further north and west for Chung Eun would be good. 
>--Joe Duncan 
 
I haven't seen any other comments.  Do we consider this a majority then, or 
what? 
 
>>>2) Are we making a new MIndia on Skothar or not?  
  
Overwhelmingly No. 
 
>>>3) We MUST decide why the outside world has not heard of the MOrient before. 
 
>What about spirits+barbarians+culture+underwater race? I think we need many 
>factors to explain why MChina hasn't been discovered yet, one or two is not 
>enough for a such big area... 
>--Gabriele Ferri  
 
This seems to be the most plausible and agreeable choice.  We'll Make a 
bunch of reasons, and if you have a personal preference, use it more than 
the others.

  Sorry, I'll add my two bits here:  I thought that Patrick's map was very 
well laid out.  I think we should go with it for now.  If we find we run 
into some problems because of the layout later, we can always fine tune 
it as we go along.

  Ditto here.

  I like the idea of a collection of things keeping them from having been 
"found" before.  It definitely gives a DM more options to choose from. 
 
  One thing I've been meaning to ask -- what /time period/ are we developing 
for?  I realize that Chung-Eun at least is more or less hidden during the  
time of the original Gazetteers, but the Island of Zyxl (Jiku-Shiru) is  
mentioned somewhere and so some of these countries must be trading partners 
with some known places (perhaps Sind, the Divinarchy of Yav or maybe even 
Minrothad?).  Also, it is always possible for Shipwrecks (or other disasters) 
to occur, tossing PC's from any era into lands of unknown location... 
 
  My personal preference is to start developing data for the original Gaz  
time period (~ 1000AC) -- partly because I have no knowledge /whatsoever/  
about the WOI stuff.  Besides, we can also develop that time period too! 
So, my proposal is that we develop some ancient history stuff (simple stuff,  
about migrations and general developments, like how the original Gaz's  
discuss history), begin by concentrating on places and events in the 1000AC  
period and then move on to the WOI time period as well.

The effects of WoI on MORient would depend for the most part on how 
much contact they have had with the rest of the world in general and with 
Alphatia in particular.  There are two points of interest for MOrient history 
after 1000 AC: 
 
1) The "good" Immortals have divided into two hostile factions -- one  
consisting of Ixion, Valerias, Ilsundal, and Alphatia, and the other  
consisting of Rad, Vanya, Ka, Rafiel, Eiryndul, Asterius, Rathanos, 
and Korotiku.  If Immortals of the first faction are worshipped in MOrient, 
then nothing much should happen -- that faction would not want the 
nations from Skothar to distract Alphatia from its war with various 
western nations.  If Immortals of the second faction are worshipped  
in MOrient, then they may agitate for various nations of Skothar to 
harass Alphatia in various ways.  If Immortals of both factions are 
worshipped in MOrient, then conflicts between the followers of one 
faction and the followers of the other could occur and lead to violence, 
even if such things did not occur in the past. 
 
Meanwhile, the Immortals of Entropy form a third faction that generally 
supports the underdog -- they want the conflict between these two factions 
of Immortals to last as long as possible.  After the events of WoI are 
terminated by the interference of what may have been an Old One, the 
Immortals go back to their previous cautious strategies in dealing with 
one another. 
 
2) The sinking of Alphatia in 1009 AC may well have caused minor tidal waves 
along the northwestern coast of Skothar, but the only other notable effect  
would have been the power vacuum created by the sinking.  Keep in mind 
that Alphatia is the only nation to have had dealings with Skothar -- and 
most 
of those dealings appear to have been hostile.  They had conquered the  
peninsula of Esterhold and enslaved its Jennite inhabitants.  There are many 
references to their conflicts with Minaean pirates, who appear to live along 
the coast of Skothar immediately to the east of Bellissaria. 
 
As of 960 AC, appears to have been ignorant of Tangor and the "Great Empire" 
of MChina -- or perhaps the depiction of these nations on the Thyatian map 
was so distorted that he did not make the association.  In particular, the 
location given on the proposed map of Skothar puts MChina in a different  
location from the "Empire of the Great Khan" -- it is actually a part of 
Tangor 
according to the seriously distorted Thyatian map. 
 
But it is not necessary to assume a complete lack of contact between 
Alphatia and MOrient -- just that any such contact prior to 965 AC was not 
common knowledge.  Remember, Haldemar never visited Skothar!  Thus, 
it is quite possible that Alphatian merchants and adventurers opened up 
contact with MChina towards the end of the 10th century, only to withdraw 
as the concerns of WoI diverted their attention.  On the other hand, MChina 
could still have a substantial colony of Alphatian expatriates -- perhaps the 
beginning of MHong Kong?

I looked through my D&D stuff and it looks like these are the only 
significant resources on Skothar, other than our compilation of course.  I 
searched them, recording page references, and it was a lot of work, and it's 
enough for me for now.  I hope this helps someone.  If anyone knows more, or 
can find out, please update the list and repost it.

So here's the summary of my opinions on our gameplan: 
----- 
teams, stop group posts - end of March to mid April 
compilation & vote - early May to June (just my guess and hope, does this 
actually sound                                         feasible and not too 
much work?) 
vote results - early to mid June 
small teamwork - from here on, and now we have the summer if we want
