&quot;CM&quot; stands for the 1st Ed. AD&amp;D Statistic Comeliness. While this
is not even a standard AD&amp;D Statistic, let alone a standard OD&amp;D
Statistic, it is used in my campaigns and so is included in these NPC
descriptions. Think of Comeliness as a measure of physical beauty, versus
Charisma that is a measure of persuasiveness and personal magnetism.</i> </p>

<h4><a name="A2.Magic">Appendix 2: Magic Items</a></h4>
<dl>
<dt><a name="A2.Balance"><b><i>Balance of Conversion</i></b></a></dt>
<dd><p>Balance scale, with 6&quot; diameter trays. Placing coin (up to 500cn if
in a bag) on the left side and saying the correct command word gets a gem of
approximately equal value on right side. Placing a gem on the right side and
saying the correct command word gets coin of approximately equal value on left.
</p>
<p>Command word to get gems: Be-schu (&quot;Bijou&quot;). Command word to get
coin: Ar-zjon (&quot;Argent&quot;)</p>
<p>The gems are usually of a type that has an average value appropriate for the
original value in coin. Coin produced is usually gold pieces from a particular
location (i.e., Thyatian Royals). However, if the PC using it concentrates, he
can attempt to select the gem type and quality or the coin denomination and
origin. The user must be familiar with the type of gem or coin they are
requesting for this to work. There is a 5% chance of failure for each request
that is different from the default (i.e., requesting platinum has a 5% chance
of failure, platinum from a different country (i.e., Sind) has a 10% chance).
If the user requests something that is, for all practical purposes,
'impossible' (i.e. platinum from Darokin, or a 500gp piece of quartz) the scale
will revert to producing its regular default.</p>

<p>The <i>Balance of Conversion</i> can be used as an ordinary scale if
desired, but the PC needs to own a set of merchant's weights in order to do so.

<dt><a name="A2.Passwall"><b><i>Passwall Ring</i></b></a></dt>
<dd>
    <p>Created by Matrissa to give herself access to her <a href="4.html#21.SpecialStorage">Special 
      Storage Room (room 21)</a> it allows the wearer to cast <i>Passwall</i> 
      twice per day. The wearer must think of the command word and hold his hand 
      out towards the surface in which the passageway is to be cut. The surface 
      must be within the regular range of the spell. The command word is the Common 
      Galantrian phrase &quot;Let Me Pass&quot; and is engraved inside the band.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="A2.Clairaudience"><b><i>Ring of Clairaudience</i></b></a></dt>
<dd><p>This ring has an amethyst on it that may be easily separated from the
ring by a simple twist. If the PC wearing the ring places the stone somewhere,
he will be able to hear anything said within 60' of the stone, assuming that a
normal human sitting at the stone's location would have heard it (i.e.,
whispers must be near by or they will be unclear or even undetected). The
effective range between the ring and the stone is 1 mile.</p>
<p>The stone by itself is worth 100gp.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="A2.Fashion"><b><i>Ring of Fashion</i></b></a></dt>
<dd><p>This ring allows the wearer to swap out current clothing for any outfit
they can imagine. All outfits created by the ring have AC9. Simple
concentration for one round will bring original clothing back from the
dimension it was swapped into. Note that large pieces of metal (i.e. chain or
plate mail or studded leather armour) will negate the power of the ring.</p>
<p>Small magical items (rings, bracers and jewellery) will remain on the ring's
user; larger items (such as magical leather armour) will swap out with normal
clothing. </p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of times the user may use the power of this
ring in a given day. However, there is a 1% chance each use of producing a
random set of clothing (instead of that desired by the user). This set of
clothing will last for 1d6 turns before fading and the ring's user will not be
able to retrieve their real clothing until it comes back on its own.</p>
<p>The Command word for this ring: Sha-nel (&quot;Chanel&quot;)</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="A2.RangeEx"><b><i>Ring of Range Extension</i></b></a></dt>
<dd><p>This ring extends the spell ranges for any spell caster (Paladin, Cleric
or Magic User). It originally contained 25 charges, although Matrissa has used
three charges, so it only has 22 charges left. It is not rechargeable. The
power is activated by directed thought of the wearer.</p>
<p>Charge use is cumulative - i.e., one charge doubles range, two will triple
the range, etc. Will not extend spells with a range of 0&quot; or touch and
does not extend the spell's area of effect. The ring's power can be used for
spells cast from scroll or other device but can't be used to cast a spell into
a plane other than that which the wearer currently occupies.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="A2.Mapping"><b><i>Scroll of Mapping</i></b></a></dt>
<dd>(From <cite>Rules Cyclopedia</cite>, p235) Appears to be a blank scroll.
When held and commanded to write this scroll will draw a map of an area chosen.
The area must be completely within 100' of the scroll, and it may be up to
10,000 square feet in size. The scroll has 1 chance in 6 to detect secret
doors, but it will not draw what lies beyond them. The scroll functions once
per day.</dd>
