<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>You see a stately manor, made of carefully hewn granite. There are several
multi-paned windows in view. There is a pathway made of some type of black,
crushed stone which leads up to a short set of stairs that are 10' wide. The
stairs lead up to a five-foot deep recess in the middle of the building's
facade. There is a set of double doors at the back. To your left, as you face
the house, there is a 15' high, rough stone wall with nasty looking spikes
along the top that surrounds a rather large region - possibly a private garden.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The elaborate double doors are made of oak and there is an ornate brass
doorknocker in the middle of each door. The doors are well locked and trapped.
Anyone attempting to pick the locks without proper precautions will trigger a
needle trap for 1d6+1 hp damage and set off a mechanical alarm. Matrissa can
hear the alarm throughout level 1 and the front part of level 2. If someone
uses the doorknockers, Matrissa will hear them only if she is somewhere on
level 1. If she hears them from anywhere but her bath, she will answer the door
after three rounds (30 sec). If she is in her bath she will ignore any knocks
unless they are extremely persistent - after four distinct knocking sessions
she will grab her robe and storm to the door. She will NOT be very pleasant,
and will REFUSE to talk with the PC's at this or any later time.</p>
<p>If the rocks of the path are examined closely, it will be discovered that it
is, in fact, made of bits of jet. (Well, what else was she going to do with all
that leftover waste material???)</p>
<h4><a name="01a.OutsideWest">1a. West of the Manor</a></h4>
<p>Tell the following to anyone who searches the outside of the grounds to the
W of the house:</p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>Close to the ground you see a 7' long, 2' high wooden door on the W wall,
near the SW corner of the building. It has a thick rusted chain and a large,
rusty padlock attached to the front.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is the opening into the log chute into the <a href="4.html#14.WoodStorage">Wood 
  Storage (area 14)</a>. The padlock is very simple and there are no traps on 
  it, but because of the rust it is difficult to unlock, even with the key - subtract 
  5% from a thief's chance of picking it. If the characters try to break it by 
  force, they may do so by hitting it with a blunt weapon (i.e. mace, hammer) 
  and rolling to hit AC 7. Note that the noise they make has a 5% cumulative chance 
  per blow of attracting Matrissa's attention if she is in the <a href="#09.Bedroom">Bedroom 
  (area 9)</a>. They may also try to break the chain with leverage by inserting 
  an object between the chain and the door and then rolling successfully against 
  strength. If the roll fails by more than 5, check to see if the stick/staff 
  breaks instead by rolling Percentile dice. There is a 50% chance of breaking 
  a thin lever (i.e. sticks, broom handles, etc.) and a 15% chance of breaking 
  a thick lever (i.e. a staff, the handle of a war hammer, etc.).</p>
<h4><a name="01b.OutsideEast">1b. East of the Manor</a></h4>
<p>Tell the following to anyone who searches the outside of the grounds to the
E of the house:</p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>:Here, up against the spike-topped wall, there is a small, stable, which
could hold two horses. The stable roof is slightly slanted out from the wall,
being about 8' from the ground against the wall and 7' from the ground at the
opposite side. The stable looks to be a bit on the ramshackle side, in distinct
contrast to the immaculate appearance of rest of the manor. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The stable doors are not currently barred, although there is a sturdy wooden
bar lying outside on the ground. There is currently only one horse inside,
housed in the stall farthest from the door, who appears to be a bit on the
mangy side. A perceptive PC might conclude that only exactly the minimum level
of maintenance has been done in this area in order to keep the horse alive,
sheltered, fed and capable of carrying a passenger. The horse, if examined, is
healthy if not well groomed, and will travel at regular rates. She is an
incredibly docile steed who is black, with a white star on her forehead and a
white 'sock' on her front left leg.</p>
<p>The PC's may try to use this structure as an aid to climbing up over the
garden wall. (See the <a href="#05.Garden">Garden (area 5)</a> for more info
about climbing the wall) </p>
<h4><a name="02.Foyer">2. Foyer and Hallway</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>:The foyer is ornate and quite spacious and there are examples of
Matrissa's work on granite pedestals scattered about the room. There is a very
nice crystal chandelier in this room, which appears to be lit without candles.
There is also a rather nice abstract tapestry hanging on the W wall. Through an
opening in the N wall, a hallway can be seen which has a burgundy rug down the
centre.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Matrissa will usually invite visitors into her foyer if she answers a knock
on the door and will ask them their business. If they say they are seeking to
purchase artwork, she will ask them into the <a href="#04.Lounge">Lounge (area
4)</a>. </p>
<p>The art in this area is as tasteful as that which she offered for sale.
Against the West wall, there are two busts, flanking the entrance to the
Lounge. On the N side of the entrance the bust is of a very young, beautiful
female human (about 13 or 14 years old) who appears to have just dropped off to
sleep. On the S side, there is a handsome human male with a calm and mellow
look. Against the E wall, to the N of the tapestry, there is an
&quot;intricately carved&quot; gruff and craggy faced dwarf.</p>
<p>The <b>tapestry (50gp, 600cn)</b> is 6'x9' in size and is from the Emirates
of Ylaruam.</p>
<p>The hallway provides access to all the other rooms of the top floor and to
the stairs that lead down to the &quot;public basement&quot; - the front
section of level 2. Anyone in the hallway at night will notice that light
always spills into the hallway from the Foyer and the <a

<h4><a name="03.CloakCupboard">3. Cloak Cupboard</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>:There are hooks on the back wall with two cloaks hanging from them. There
are two pairs of boots on the floor to the left of the door. A sturdy oak staff
leans against the back wall.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The cloaks are both of good quality and in good repair, and would fetch a
fair price if sold. One is a <b>long, heavy, winter cloak (1gp, 15cn if not
worn)</b>, the other is a <b>shorter, lighter, summer cloak (5sp, 10cn if not
worn)</b>. One pair of boots is a plain pair of <b>soft leather boots (1gp,
10cn if not worn)</b> and the other is a pair of <b>calf-high hard leather
boots (5gp, 15cn if not worn)</b>. The staff is a <b>Staff +2</b>. If
confronted and forced into hand to hand nearby, Matrissa will attempt to get
and use this staff against the party.</p>
<h4><a name="04.Lounge">4. Lounge</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>:This is a well-appointed lounge, with one couch, a low table, several
chairs, a side table, and a luxurious rug in the centre. There is a tiger skin
on the floor across from the couch. Opposite from the main entrance into the
room there is a deep fireplace. The S wall is mostly a large, paned glass
window, but just beneath that there is a row of shelves with a variety of
artistic trinkets and nick-knacks on it. Against the N wall there is a cabinet
with a roll-up top and two doors on the bottom. In the corner to the S of the
fireplace there stands a beautiful full size harp and in the corner to the N
there are two pedestals upon which sit examples of Matrissa's work. There is
also a large oil painting on the W wall, just to the N of the main entrance
into this room.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Matrissa will be a kind and charming hostess, offering her visitors a drink 
  while she listens to their proposition. If asked to do a commissioned work she 
  will be adamantly against it, instead offering to sell some of her existing 
  work to the players. She should be a hard sell - players should have to bargain 
  hard to get any sort of &quot;deal&quot; from her. If asked, she will take the 
  visitors down to the <a href="4.html#16.ArtRoom">Art Room (area 16)</a> to show 
  them her current &quot;work in progress&quot;.</p>
<p>The two busts in the corner are just a bit disturbing. Both are human and
female, and in each case there is a definite, look of pain or anguish in the
expression. In fact, one even appears to be crying (on close inspection a PC
will notice that Matrissa has actually managed to &quot;carve&quot; thin
rivulets of tears down her face. If questioned, Matrissa will comment on how
art has become so plain and stagnant these days, everyone always re-doing the
same old emotions - joy, happiness, love, etc. - over and over again. She will
then say that she wanted to try &quot;shaking up the art world&quot; a little,
and so she decided to try portraying pain and sadness. She will then make a
point of staring directly into the eyes of whoever brought up the subject, and
ask him or her how he or she feels when looking at these pieces of art.</p>
<p>There are <b>two bottles of wine (15sp, 35cn each)</b>, and <b>three
half-quart crystal decanters (15sp, 10cn each)</b> of <b>flavoured liqueurs
(20sp, 15cn per half-quart)</b> under the roll-top part of the cabinet. There
are <b>eight crystal wine goblets (30sp, 5cn each)</b> and <b>eight crystal
liqueur glasses (20sp, 3cn each)</b> behind the lower doors of the cabinet. The
<b>trinkets and nick-knacks</b> collectively come to <b>150gp</b>, and should
have approximately <b>100cn encumbrance</b> (the DM may pick specific items).
The <b>rug (300gp, 5500cn)</b> is 18'x27' in size and is hand knotted wool from
the Kingdom of Sind. The <b>tiger skin (10gp, 120cn)</b> is quite old and only
in fair shape. The <b>harp (80gp, 500cn)</b> is a luxurious, hand carved
instrument with touches of gold filigree and is in excellent condition -
Matrissa has taken very good care of it, and it may be possible to sell it for
considerably more than its &quot;worth&quot; to the right buyer. The <b>framed
oil painting (200gp, 200cn)</b> depicts a rather nasty looking Black Dragon in
flight and is 5'x3' in size.</p>
<p>There is a trap door that leads into the <a
href="4.html#17.Unfinished">Unfinished Room (area 17)</a> under the NE corner 
  of the rug. The door will be obvious to anyone if the corner of the rug is lifted.</p>
<h4><a name="05.Garden">5. Garden</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This is a private garden surrounded by a 15' high wall that is topped with
nasty looking spikes. The paths seem to be covered with the same sort of
crushed stone that the front path is made of. The garden appears quite lovely
and well maintained and there are bushes, flowers, and trees scattered
throughout. There is even a small herb and vegetable patch to the N of the
stairway into the manor. There are a few benches in sight, and several examples
of Matrissa's work can be seen on pedestals at various places along the edge of
the paths.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The walls surrounding the garden are actually quite easy to climb, since the
style of construction has left many foot and hand holds that even a non-thief
characters to exploit. However, the spikes at the top of the wall are actually
extremely sharp and anyone attempting to climb over the wall has a 75% chance
that they will cut themselves, taking 1 hp of damage, as they pass over the
top. This chance drops to 50% if a PC says he is taking 'extreme caution' while
climbing over. Note that once over the top, the PC's must still climb down the
inside of the 15' wall.</p>
<p>The door into the house is normally locked but not trapped.</p>
<p>The benches are made of wood, and the pedestals for all the statues appear
to be made of granite. The place appears quite idyllic unless the PC's take a
closer look at some of the busts. Each bust is, of course, made of the purest
jet, and there is a brass plaque on each occupied pedestal that names the bust
in question. The busts are identified below by the letter shown on the map of
level 1.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><i>Timid</i>: This bust is that of a female Elf, with very short, straight
hair. She is glancing downward in a shy, demure manner. It is no more or less
remarkable than the specimens that were sold in Darokin.</li>
<li><i>The Sheriff</i>: This bust is that of an older male Hin, with a mop of
curly hair and an intricately carved pipe between his teeth. It is only more
remarkable than the specimens that were sold in Darokin in that his general
appearance seems so completely plain, ordinary, and unassuming.</li>
<li>This pedestal is empty</li>
<li> <i>Young Fear</i>: This bust is that of a very &quot;pretty&quot; young
male human - he would seem to be no more than 12 or 13 years old. The look in
his face would be best described as mortal fear.</li>
<li>This pedestal is empty</li>
<li>This pedestal is empty</li>
<li><i>The Scream</i>: This bust depicts the face of a beautiful young human
female, who is quite obviously screaming at the top of her lungs. It is
difficult to tell if the scream is from fear or from pain.</li>
<li><i>Determination</i>: This bust depicts the face of an older, battle
scared, but still attractive, human with a finely chiselled face, and a look of
raw, hate filled determination. It tends to remind one of the old adage
&quot;if looks could kill, you'd be dead five times over.&quot;</li>
<li><i>The Lovers</i>: This bust is quite unique in that it is actually a dual
bust of two lovers. In fact, it is even more atypical of ordinary single busts,
as the arms of both participant are there, wrapped about each other, as they
stare deeply into each other's eyes. Upon close inspection, it will be noticed
that each figure appears to be carved from a separate block, yet the way their
arms are wrapped about each other, would seem to suggest that they must have
been carved from one block, not two.</li>

<tr>
<td>This is a gorgeous Dinning room lit by a beautiful crystal chandelier that
glows without candles. The chandelier hangs above a massive oak table that
currently has eleven straight-backed chairs around it. A twelfth chair can be
seen in the NE corner of the room, against the N wall. A large, paned glass
window dominates the N wall. There is a deep a fireplace against the E wall and
beside it, to the N, there is a large, framed oil painting. On the S wall,
between the entrances from the hallway, there is a tall cabinet with paned
glass doors at the top and drawers along the bottom. There is also a 15' long
shelf along the W wall, and what appears to be a folding wooden screen above it
that separates this room and the next one.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The cabinet displays a set of <b>eight china place settings (75sp, 50cn each
place)</b> behind the glass. The first drawer holds a set of <b>eight
silverware place settings (50sp, 5cn each place)</b> to go with the dishes, and
the second drawer holds a <b>table cloth (1gp, 5cn)</b>, <b>eight napkins (1sp,
1cn each)</b>, and <b>eight cloth place mats (2sp, 1cn each)</b>. The <b>framed
oil painting (150gp, 200cn)</b> is 5'x3' in size and is a picture of a hydra
attacking a sailing ship during a heavy storm.</p>
<h4><a name="07.Kitchen">7. Kitchen</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This appears to be a large, well-stocked kitchen. There is a long counter
along the W and part of the S wall, with pots and pans and other utensils on it
or hanging on the wall above it, and a basin in the middle of it. There is also
a 15' long shelf along the E wall, with what appears to be a folding wooden
screen above it that separates this room and the next one. In the centre of the
room, there is a large, thick, well used, wooden &quot;butchers table&quot;,
that has a block containing several sharp knives sitting on it. In the centre
of the N wall there is a deep fireplace. A table and 4 chairs sit in front of
the fireplace. Oddly, there appear to be two metal pipes extending between the
W side of the fireplace and the W wall.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Nothing of any real interest here. If the PC's are interested in the pots,
pans, cutlery and stoneware, tell them they find very several examples of
plain, serviceable but very ordinary kitchen items. They could probably find
just about anything you'd expect in a standard kitchen here.</p>
<p>The two pipes are part of Matrissa's bath water heating system. A PC who
investigates the fireplace will see that the two pipes extend across its back
and join on the E side to form a U-shape. There is a shut-off valve just
outside the fireplace on the back-most pipe. See the <a
href="#08.Pantry">Kitchen Pantry (area 8)</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The basin in the counter has a drain that eventually exits, along with other
basins in the manor, into the underground river of level 4.</p>
<h4><a name="08.Pantry"> 8. Kitchen Pantry</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This 10'x10' room appears to be a kitchen pantry, with a water pump near
the N wall and several shelves on the S wall. Various foodstuffs can be seen on
most flat surfaces. What is particularly unusual is a series of metal pipes and
basins connected to the water pump. First, the pump is somewhat taller than
usual, standing about 3-&#189;' above the ground instead of the normal 2'. A
circular basin surrounds the main upright pipe at about the 3' level. The basin
is currently stopped and is also full of water, although it has a drain with a
pipe extending from it and through the kitchen wall. This pipe is just slightly
off of horizontal, so that any drained water would flow towards the kitchen.
There is another pipe that enters from the kitchen just behind and slightly
lower than the drainpipe, which also slopes down, but this time towards the W
wall. This second pipe extends right across the N wall and then turns S at the
NW corner and ends at a small metal cistern in the SW corner.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Contains standard &quot;everyday&quot; pantry items, such as fresh fruit and
vegetables, dried herbs and spices, a couple of eggs, a loaf of bread, etc.
There is a bundle of <b>garlic</b> in here with <b>three unused buds</b> still
on it.</p>
<p>In the basin around the water pump, there is some fresh meat wrapped in
waxed butchers paper and string, and a small earthenware jug containing fresh
milk.</p>
<p>The pump produces a fairly fast stream of water, filling the basin in under
a minute. However, it takes a full turns of slow pumping to fill the cistern
which Matrissa accesses via a spigot in her <a href="#11.Bathroom">Bathroom
(area 11)</a>. The cistern is permanently attached to the S wall.</p>
<p>The pipe set-up through the kitchen fireplace can be used to heat the water
going into the cistern by closing the shut off valve for a short time and
letting the water heat before letting it continue to the cistern. To get a full
tank of hot water takes two turns because of the need to start and stop the
flow for heating purposes. Of course, the presence of heated pipes in a cool
kitchen pantry defeats part of its purpose - keeping food from spoiling - but
that fact didn't occur to Matrissa when she designed the set-up.</p>
<h4><a name="09.Bedroom">9. Bedroom</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This is a well-appointed bedroom. A paned glass window dominates the S
wall. On the W wall is a deep fireplace, and in the SW corner is a roughly
L-shaped boudoir with a chair sitting in front of it and a double hinged mirror
across the back of it. There is a woven cloth rug on the floor, and a large,
comfortable bed against the E wall. There are side tables with one drawer each
on either side of the bed. Also, in the middle of the ceiling, there is an
ornate circle of engraved brass about 2' in diameter.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The brass circle (indicated on the map with dotted lines) appears to be
flush to the ceiling but is actually a gong that is hanging from four supports
about &#189; an inch below it. Both doors to this room are automatically
trapped when locked such that if the trap has not been correctly
disarmed/removed before the lock is opened, a striker will begin to hit the
gong. The sound will not stop unless the trap is first re-armed with the key
and then properly disarmed. Note that the gong is more than 15' away from both
doors so that an active silence 15' radius at the doors will NOT stop it from
going off.</p>
<p>There is a trap door that leads into the <a
href="4.html#19.Meditation">Meditation Room (area 19)</a> under the NW corner 
  of the rug. The door will be obvious to anyone if the corner of the rug is lifted. 
</p>
<p>The bedside tables have a &quot;pendant like&quot; metal handle that dangles
from a small vertical metal ring that is attached to a 1&quot; diameter metal
disk in the centre of the drawer. The drawers are not locked but are both
trapped with a needle trap that does 1d6 damage and the victim must save vs.
poison or fall unconscious for 1d4+2 turns. Such a victim can only be woken
before this time is up by a neutralize poison spell (or other similar effect).
The traps can be avoided by twisting the pendant 90&#176; to left or right
before opening the drawer. The drawer of the bedside table on the left of the
bed (the W side) contains <b>two daggers +1</b>. The drawer to right of the bed
(the E side) contains a <b>belt pouch with 3pp, 7gp, 18sp and 11cp</b> in it. 
</p>
<p>If Matrissa is in her bath, there is a set of fine clothes and a large key
ring tossed on her bed (see Matrissa's description for more information on the
key ring). If she is was in bed, the key ring will be in the same drawer as the
belt pouch.</p>
<p>If Matrissa is disturbed while sleeping one of her first instincts will be
to get her daggers from the drawer (she will never be caught by her own trap) 
</p>
<p>The drawer of the boudoir contains <b>10 sheets of blank parchment (1gp, 5cn
each)</b>, <b>2 unused quill pens (5sp, 1cn each)</b>, a <b>fresh vial of ink
(1gp, 20cn when full)</b> {there is enough ink to write 50 pages of simple
text} and <b>an empty 50 page journal (20gp, 30cn)</b>. There is a <b>silver

clothing on hangers. There are also some shelves up the S wall with some folded
clothing on them. Several pairs of shoes and slippers are also on the floor
underneath the shelves.</td>

<p>There is nothing of much interest here, except that the clothing is all
either very nice quality or very sturdy in make. Most of the clothing is black
although two or three items are rich colours such as burgundy and emerald
green. There are <b>9 full sets of fine clothes (20gp, 20cn if not worn)</b>,
<b>1 bathrobe (2gp, 10cn if not worn)</b>, <b>1 night-gown (2gp, 5cn if not

(1gp, 8cn each if not worn)</b>, and <b>1 pair of soft slippers (2sp, 4cn if
not worn)</b>. A female PC of approximately the same height and weight as
Matrissa could wear any of these items. All are in good condition and it would
be possible to sell them for a fair price.</p>
<p>If Matrissa is in her bath, the bathrobe and slippers will not be in the
cupboard. If Matrissa was in her bed, there will be another set of fine clothes
and another pair of sturdy shoes in the cupboard and the nightgown will not be
in the cupboard.</p>
<h4><a name="11.Bathroom">11. Bathroom</a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>This appears to be a bathing room. On the E wall is an indoor latrine, N of
it is a small counter with a basin in it. The basin has a hole in the centre of
it that can be stopped. The small counter has a drainpipe that goes into the E
wall. Against the W wall, in the SW corner is a counter with two cupboard doors
underneath it and a mirror on the wall above it. At the N end of the room there
is a raised region with three steps leading up to it and a 5'x10' bathing tub
sunk into the middle of it. A spigot comes out of N wall over the bathing tub.
There are three wooden pegs on the W wall between the counter and the bathing
area.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There are <b>3 thick, fluffy towels (2sp, 5cn each)</b> in the cupboards
under the counter, unless Matrissa is in here, when there will be two in the
cupboard and one hanging on one of the wooden pegs, or if Matrissa has gone to
bed, when there will be one dropped on the floor somewhere.</p>
<p>The metal basin sunk can be lifted out without difficulty. It can be filled
from the spigot, if water has been let into the cistern (see the
<a href="#08.Pantry">Kitchen Pantry (area 8)</a> for more details). Water from
the basin must be used to rinse out the indoor latrine.</p>
<p>The tub is 3' deep but has 1-&#189;' high, 1' wide shelf along the S side
(i.e. a place to sit). At the bottom, near the SE edge of the tub there is a
drain with a stopper in it blocked. How full the tub is depends on when the
PC's enter this room. If it is empty and the cistern is full, it will fill the
tub up to about 2&quot; from the top. This takes about 1-&#189; turns (15
minutes). It will (obviously) be full if Matrissa is having her bath. Matrissa
partially fills the cistern with cold water in the early morning, so that she
has water for the basin and latrine. In the late afternoon she drains it and
then starts to fill it with hot water, so that it will be ready for her evening
bath. Once it is filled, Matrissa will light a fire underneath it to heat the
water.</p>
<p>The drains from the basin, the latrine and the bathing tub all eventually
exit into the underground river of level 4.</p>
<p>If Matrissa is in her bath, there will be a pair of slippers on the floor
and a bathrobe hanging on one of the wooden pegs (see
<a href="#10.BedroomCupboard">Bedroom Cupboard (area 10)</a> for details on
this clothing). If Matrissa has not met the PC's before she will begin by
acting indignant and requesting that the interlopers tell her just exactly what
they are doing in her bathroom. She will also use a <i>telekinesis</i> spell to
grab her bathrobe off the wall. If the PC's don't have some plausible and
reasonable explanation she will immediately cast <i>hold person</i>, and then
act accordingly. If the PC's manage to escape from this situation and Matrissa

<p>This is Matrissa's library for regular books. The bookcases are not full,
although there are a fair number of volumes in here. None of them particularly
stand out and each should be worth somewhere between 40 and 200gp to the right
buyer. It is left to the DM's discretion what particular books the PC's might
find here.</p>
<p>Pushing sharply on the E part of the corner bookcase will open the secret
door in the NE corner. This will release the catch and cause it to pop into the
room, pivoting about the W end of the N side. Pushing it back in and releasing
it slowly will cause the catch to fasten, closing it again. It opens into the
<a href="#13.SecretStairs">Secret Stairs (area 13)</a>.</p>

<p>These stairs go down 20' to the <a href="4.html#22.Landing">Dungeon Landing 
  (area 22)</a> on level 2. The door at the top of the stairs is not secret on 
  this side as it has a metal handle on it. To open the door a person must pull 
  it sharply towards them, releasing the catch, and then allow the door to pop 
  open away from them.</p>
