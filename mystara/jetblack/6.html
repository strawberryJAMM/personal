<p>Read the following if the PC's travel down through the secret door from the 
  <a href="5.html#27.WorkroomLaboratory">Magical Workroom and Laboratory (area 
  27)</a></p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This passage is roughly hewn out of stone and has stairs that descend
approximately 30'. It appears to end at a dead end.</td>

<p>The secret door into the <a href="5.html#27.WorkroomLaboratory">Magical Workroom 
  and Laboratory (area 27)</a> isn't a &quot;secret&quot; on this side, as it 
  has an obvious latch for opening it. However the door into the river cavern 
  is secret on both sides. To open it, a particular spot on the door must be pressed 
  inwards.</p>
<p>Read the following if the PC's find the Secret door at the bottom of the
passageway and figure out how to open it:</p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>The secret doorway exits onto an irregularly shaped shallow beach. To the N
is an underground river that flows from the E to the W. To the SW there is a
curved rock wall and an entrance into a deep cavern that has been blocked by
bars. There is a locked gateway at the W-most end of the bars. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is a special &quot;back door&quot; that Matrissa could use in an
ultimate emergency. Carved into the curved wall to the SW are is a deep shelf
with two vials on it. These vials contain a <b>potion of water breathing</b>
(blue) and a <b>potion of invisibility</b> (clear). From here, Matrissa could
escape by travelling <a href="#31.Upstream">Upstream (area 31)</a>. The potions
are to ensure that she can escape even if it is Spring and the river waters are
high due to rain.</p>
<p>The gate through the bars is locked and the key may be found on Matrissa's
key ring. It provides access to this area via the Cockatrice Pit (area 29),
although Matrissa is highly unlikely to try such a risky move unless she could
be sure of neutralizing the Cockatrice first.</p>
<h4><a name="29.Cockatrice">29. Cockatrice Pit </a></h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This pit is approximately 25' high and is oddly shaped, with two narrow
necks to the N and the NE. Metal bars block both necks. The bars to the NE have
a gate in them.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Unless the PC's have been in the <a
href="5.html#27.WorkroomLaboratory">Magical Workroom and Laboratory (area 27</a>) 
  and fiddled with the cage controls, tell the PCs the following:</p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>A 10' cubed cage hangs 10' from the ground, suspended beneath a 10' square
hole in the ceiling by four cables. The bottom of the cage is open.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If the cage is up in the <a href="5.html#27.WorkroomLaboratory">Magical Workroom 
  and Laboratory (area 27)</a> tell them the following.</p>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>There is a 10' square hole in the ceiling of the cavern.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There is a 10' square marked on the map to show you where the cage is
located in space.</p>
<p>This is where Matrissa's Cockatrice &quot;lives&quot;. It is a <i>shockingly
black cockatrice</i> which is like a regular Cockatrice in all respect except
that its feathers and scales are a dull matte-black and it turns its victims
into black jet instead of a more standard stone such as granite. It will attack
any living being that enters the pit.</p>
<p> <b>(Cockatrice AC 6. HD 5**, hp 28, MV 90'(30') {flying 180'(60')}, #AT 1
beak, D 1d6 + petrifaction, SV F5, ML 7, XP 425.)</b></p>
<p>The sides of the cavern are curved and smooth and were obviously created by
water action - this was once part of the underground river, before the course
changed due to erosion of the walls. The floor is sandy and slightly damp. The
bars were put in by Matrissa to stop her Cockatrice and any of her potential
&quot;artwork&quot; escaping this way.</p>
<h4><a name="30.Downstream">30. Downstream </a></h4>
<p>If the PC's choose to investigate in this direction, tell them that they
eventually discover several pipes exiting from the cavern wall after a short
distance. These are the various drainpipes from her indoor plumbing. There
should be some refuse still dripping out of the pipes and the smell should be
described as pungent.</p>
<p>If the PC's explore any farther in this direction tell them that the
corridor starts to get steeper and steeper the further they go. If the water is
at its normal levels, they may successfully explore for a short distance,
however, if they insist on going further, mention that as the angle of descent
is getting steeper the speed of the water is increasing. If they still persist
after several warnings, have one or two of them loose their balance but
recover. The river cavern falls away in an abrupt lip some distance beyond this
area and the water falls down a wet, slippery chute to an unknown depth. Any
character who is foolish enough to continue and looses his balance near this
point should fail to regain his feet and be swept away, never to be heard from
again.</p>
<h4><a name="31.Upstream">31. Upstream</a></h4>
<p>If the PC's choose to explore in this direction, they should be able to make
it all the way to the ravine where the stream first dips underground which is
some distance away from Matrissa's manor. Normally, the river is shallow enough
between here and the ravine for the PC's to travel without difficulty (except
for being in the dark). Even if spring rains have made the water higher, the DM
should make it just possible for someone to escape this way without needing to
be able to breath water.</p>
