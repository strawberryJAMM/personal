<td>This room is very obviously some kind of Torture Chamber. There are a row
of manacles on the N wall, two &quot;racks&quot; with manacles for arms and
legs in the middle of the room, and an iron maiden in the SW corner of the
room. Also on the walls hang several implements of torture, such as whips,
pinchers, etc. There is a deep fireplace on the W wall that has several metal
pokers and branding irons lying half inside it. There is also a ladder near the
E corner of the S wall that goes up to the ceiling.</td>

<p>The ladder goes up to a trap door in the ceiling that grants access to one 
  of the <a href="4.html#20.PassThroughs">Secret Pass Throughs (area 20)</a> that

<p>The DM should feel free to be creative when describing just exactly what
Matrissa is up to if she is in here.</p>
<h4><a name="27.WorkroomLaboratory">27. Magical Workroom and Laboratory </a> 
</h4>
<table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>This is a large room with stone floor. It appears to be some kind of
workroom or laboratory. It contains two deep fireplaces, one in the N and one
in the E wall.<br>
<br>
On the W side of the room, there are two sets of tall, deep cupboards with
doors right against the W wall, on either side of a door. In front of the
cupboards are two 25' long, 5' wide counters with more cupboard space
underneath.<br>
<br>
On the E side of the room, there is another 25' x 5' counter, with a 25' x 10'
bank of cages to the S of it. <br>
<br>
Each counter has a few stools scattered about it. One stool by the second
counter even has an animal skull with a candle stuck on top of it sitting on
top of it. There is also a stepladder at one end of this counter.<br>
<br>
On the N side of the room, there is a water pump with a basin surrounding it to
the W of the fireplace, and a large black cauldron sitting on the floor to the
E of the fireplace. In the centre of the N wall, there is a low railing
surrounding a 10' square region. On the wall to the W of this region are two
metal levers. E of this region is a workbench with several items on it, most
notably one of Matrissa's busts and two long, thin, curved pieces of jet
sitting next to it. Beside the bench there stands what appears to be a headless
statue, also made of jet, and a jumbled pile of irregular blocks and large
fragments of jet stone.<br>
<br>
On the S side of the room, there is a 25' long bookshelf near the W side of the
S wall. There is also a metal ladder bolted against the middle of the S wall
that extends up to the ceiling.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The large cupboards and the cupboards under the Alchemy stations contain
Alchemical equipment and supplies of no particular value - the cupboards under
the counters contain extra glass and metal tubing, flasks, etc., while the tall
cupboards against the W wall have a collection of glass, stone and earthen ware
jars with a selection of chemical compounds in them. There are 40 such
containers and if the PC's choose to open and examine the contents of any
particular container, roll d20 to determine the contents on <a
href="#Table1">Table 1, below</a>.</p>
<p>The closer to the cages the PC's get the more they will notice a foul
stench. Each cage contains one or more sickly, abused and malnourished animals
(what kind is left up to the DM's choice). They are sleeping on rags that are
sodden with their own urine and faeces. None of the animals currently in
residence has the strength to put up any kind of fight. Some of them will
probably die in a few days unless they are treated appropriately by a cleric or
someone with the <i>veterinary skill</i>. Even so, some have been treated so
badly, and suffered so much from Matrissa's &quot;experiments&quot; that they
will never recover.</p>
<p>If the DM wishes, the PC's may be able to rescue one or two animals to keep
as pets. It should take a while for these abused animals to respond well to
humans, but with patience and effort they might come around. It should be
easier for someone with the appropriate animal training skill or an Elf with
the animal empathy skill.</p>
<p>Under the counter next to the bank of cages there is a macabre collection of
devices and implements for experimenting on animals, including those required
for doing dissections. It is obvious, on inspection, that this counter has been
used for just such a purpose.</p>
<p>The fireplaces will only be lit if Matrissa is currently working in this room. 
  The cauldron is currently empty and the pump is similar to the one found in 
  the <a href="3.html#08.Pantry">Kitchen Pantry (area 8)</a></p>
<p>Pushing the left hand lever next to the railed off area up one notch will cause 
  a set of pit doors in the middle of the railed area to open, and up a second 
  notch will bring a 10' x 10' cage up into the room. This cage has a door with 
  a simple latch. Looking down through the cage, there is a dark view down to 
  the floor of the <a href="6.html#29.Cockatrice">Cockatrice Pit (area 29)</a> 
  30' below this one. Without sending a light down nothing can be seen except 
  by infravision, and then only the fact that the pit is damp, and that there 
  is something alive and moving down there. Even with a light, because the &quot;floor&quot; 
  between these two areas is 5' thick, it is difficult to see much, although it 
  might be possible to get a clear glimpse of the Cockatrice. Pushing the lever 
  back down will first lower the cage and then close the pit doors again. Pushing 
  the right hand lever down causes the bottom of the cage to drop open, and lifting 
  it up will close it again.</p>
<p>The workbench against the N wall has a hammer, a saw and two chisels on it 
  as well as the pieces of jet. This is the area where Matrissa &quot;finalizes&quot; 
  her jet &quot;masterpieces&quot; by chopping their &quot;busts&quot; off after 
  telekinetically lifting the petrified body out of the <a href="6.html#29.Cockatrice">Cockatrice 
  Pit (area 29)</a> below. (She may also use wizard eye to see what she is doing 
  if the &quot;statue&quot; is not visible from the open pit.) The two long, thin, 
  curved pieces of jet are in fact the arms of the poor woman who the statue once 
  was. The bust is of a human female with shorter, curly hair. She has a pleading 
  look on her face and also appears to have been crying. The &quot;headless statue&quot; 
  is the rest of her, as can be determined if the parts are held up in their respective 
  locations. (If this is done, it should become obvious that the girl was pleading 
  for mercy).</p>
<p>The pile of jet blocks in the corner, if investigated, will produce four
bodies and eight arms. If explored fully, it should be possible for the PC's to
determine, from body physique, that there are three males and one female. One
of the male bodies was obviously an elf with waist length hair. These are the
&quot;leftovers&quot; from the busts that were sold at the auction of the </p>
<p>The books in the bookshelf are alchemical and biological in nature,
appearing to be of the sort someone doing this type of research might have
collected. The papers and whatnot on the second counter table are generally a
complete mess. There are half-finished spell scrolls with scribbles and crossed
off mistakes, there are badly kept research journals which are so confusing
that anyone who tries to figure out what she's been up to won't have a hope,
etc. If anyone does more than a cursory search they will find one complete
spell scroll containing the spell dispel magic.</p>
<p>The ladder goes up to a trap door in the ceiling that grants access to one 
  of the <a href="4.html#20.PassThroughs">Secret Pass Throughs (area 20)</a> that 
  leads between the <a href="4.html#17.Unfinished">Unfinished Room (area 17)</a> 
  and the <a href="4.html#24.Dungeon">Dungeon (area 24)</a>.</p>
<p>The secret door in the SE corner is opened on this side by sliding a slight 
  protrusion on the door in a downward direction. It is not &quot;secret&quot; 
  on the other side and has a metal handle with a latch that will release the 
  catch. It leads to the <a href="6.html#28.EscapeRoute">Secret Escape Route (area 
  28)</a> and <a href="6.html#Level4">level 4</a>.</p>
<p>If Matrissa is in here working, she will be concentrating on whatever she is
working on - either her Alchemical or Animal experiments. If she is working
with the animals, she will likely have one of them in hand or tied down on the
counter next to the cages. If she sees anyone entering this room she will
defend herself immediately.</p>
