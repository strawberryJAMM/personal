      <h3>Game Rule Information</h3>
      <p><!-- #BeginEditable "Class1" -->Sea rangers<!-- #EndEditable --> have 
        the following game statistics:</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Abilities:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Abilities" -->Dexterity 
        is important for a sea ranger because rangers tend to wear no armour at 
        all and rarely wear anything heavier than leather and also because several 
        sea ranger skills are based on Dexterity. Strength is important for them 
        because sea rangers frequently get involved in combat. Several sea ranger 
        skills are based on Wisdom, and a Wisdom score of 14 or higher is required 
        to get access to the most powerful sea ranger spells. A Wisdom score of 
        11 or higher is required to cast any sea ranger spells at all.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

      <h3>Class Features</h3>
      <p>All of the following are class features of the <!-- #BeginEditable "Class3" -->{class}<!-- #EndEditable -->. 
      </p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "Features" -->
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> The sea ranger 
        is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and light armor only. 
        Wearing armour on the high seas can be suicidal, and a sea ranger will 
        avoid it if at all possible, and rarely if ever wears anything heavier 
        than standard Leather.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">When wearing light armor or no armor, a ranger can 
        fight with two weapons as if she had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon 
        Fighting. She loses this special bonus when fighting in medium or heavy 
        armor, or when using a double-headed weapon (such as a quarterstaff or 
        double sword).</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Although any simple or martial weapon may be used, 
        the following weapons are frequently used by sea rangers and their sailing 
        associates: cutlass*, belaying pin*, boarding pike (as shortspear), dagger, 
        gaff (hook)*, gaff - pole*, harpoon (as javelin), knife*, light crossbow, 
        net, rapier, sabre*, shortbow/composite shortbow, trident.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">For weapons marked with an asterisk (*) see the 
        <a href="../equipment/weapons.htm">Weapons File</a> for details</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> <b>Spells:</b> As for standard ranger class.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><i>(Note: I may modify the spell list, but haven't 
        looked into this yet.)</i></p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Track:</b> As for standard ranger class. Note, 
        however, that the track feat has been modified slightly IMC to accommodate 
        the "aquatic specialization" of the sea ranger. See <a href="../feats/feats.htm#Track">Track</a> 
        in the <a href="../feats/feats.htm">Feats file</a> for details.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Sea Skills:</b> Due to the extensive training 
        that the sea ranger receives in and around the water, she automatically 
        gains training and competency bonuses to the following skills at 1st level:</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Aquatic Combat:</b> The sea ranger is trained 
        in the best techniques and methods for surviving combat both when on or 
        in the water. Part of this training deals specifically with the best methods 
        and techniques for dealing with the most common threats to an individual 
        who lives on, in or near the water. Due to this extensive study of her 
        potential foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them, 
        the sea ranger gains a bonus to Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot 
        checks when using these skills against creatures found in purely aquatic 
        (ocean, lake, river, etc.) and semi-aquatic (shorelines, small islands, 
        swamps, etc.) environments. Likewise, she gets the same bonus to weapon 
        damage rolls against these creatures. A sea ranger also gets the damage 
        bonus with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feat (the 
        sea ranger cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The 
        bonus doesn't apply to damage against creatures that are immune to critical 
        hits.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">The bonus gained by the ranger depends on what environment 
        the foe in question can normally be found:</p>

      <p class="first-indent">When a creature can reasonably be found in both 
        environment types, the sea ranger uses the bonus value for the purely 
        aquatic environment.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Sea Legs:</b> A sea ranger spends years living 
        and working on the water, and has learned to stay on her feet during fair 
        weather and foul. At 3rd level, a sea ranger gains a +2 competence bonus 
        to all Balance checks. Furthermore, a successful check allows a full move 
        instead of a half move. A failed check still means no movement at all. 
        [1]</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Rope Monkey:</b> Experienced seafarers can climb 
        rigging and ropes with the speed and dexterity of monkeys. Starting at 
        5th level, a sea ranger retains her Dex bonus to AC while climbing or 
        fighting on rigging, ropes or even masts. Furthermore, opponents gain 
        no bonus to hit in these circumstances. [2]</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Improved Aquatic Combat:</b> At 8th level, a 
        sea ranger has improved her knowledge of and training in the best techniques 
        and methods for surviving combat both when on or in the water. As a result, 
        she gains another bonus to damage and the use of Bluff, Listen, Sense 
        Motive, Spot against creatures found in purely aquatic (ocean, lake, river, 
        etc.) and semi-aquatic (shorelines, small islands, swamps, etc.) environments.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">As with Aquatic Combat, the bonus gained depends 
        on what environment the foe in question can normally be found:</p>

      <p class="first-indent">When a creature can reasonably be found in both 
        environment types, the sea ranger uses the bonus value for the purely 
        aquatic environment.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">This bonus stacks with the bonus from Aquatic Combat</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Aquatic Freedom:</b> Starting at 12th level, 
        a sea ranger knows how to use her abilities and weapons to their best 
        effect even when fighting underwater. As a result, when underwater, she 
        suffers no penalties to movement or attack rolls almost as if she were 
        the recipient of the <i>freedom of movement</i> spell (see the Players 
        Handbook, page 207). This is an Extraordinary ability.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Sea Lungs:</b> At 16th level, a sea ranger has 
        learned how to survive underwater for extended periods of time. She can 
        hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to quadruple her Constitution, 
        instead of double Con as normal. See page 85 of the DMG for full rules 
        on drowning. [3]</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Improved Two Weapon Fighting:</b> A sea ranger 
        with a base attack bonus of at least +9 can choose to gain the Improved 
        Two Weapon Fighting feat (see the Players Handbook, page 83) even if she 
        does not have the other prerequisites for the feat. The ranger must be 
        wearing light armor or no armor in order to use this benefit.</p>
