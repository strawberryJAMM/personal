      <p>The <!-- #BeginEditable "equipment" -->weapons<!-- #EndEditable --> found 
        in the above table are described below.</p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "EquipmentDescriptions" -->
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="BelayingPin"></a>Belaying pin:</b> Belaying 
        pins are actually small club-shaped pieces of wood or metal found aboard 
        ship. They are designed to be slipped through holes bored through the 
        ship's rail, and ships ropes are made fast (tied) to them. It can also 
        be yanked free and brought into violent contact with enemies; in a pirate 
        fight, anyone who loses a weapon or starts out without one usually ends 
        up with a belaying pin in his hand.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Cutlass"></a>Cutlass:</b> The cutlass 
        is a short, heavy sword, sharp along only one edge, with a heavy iron 
        basket hilt (a protective cup) to protect the hand. The hilt can be used 
        as a "gauntlet punch" in close quarters and also grants a +1 bonus against 
        any disarm attempt made by an opponent. </p>
      <p class="first-indent">Cutlasses are common and readily available in any 
        port community; they are much less common inland.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Foil"></a>Foil, practice:</b><span class="redfont">#</span> 
        Based on the rapier, this weapon is specially designed for practising 
        swordplay with a partner at a reduced risk of serious injury. Unlike a 
        regular rapier, a practice foil is tipped with a metal button so that 
        it is not actually capable of piercing through cloth or flesh (though 
        a solid hit can cause a serious welt and/or bruise). Proficiency in the 
        rapier grants proficiency to the practice foil.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Unless the protective button is removed from the 
        tip, it is quite difficult to use a practice foil to do any serious harm 
        to an opponent. Unlike regular weapons, a practice foil will not do even 
        a single point of subdual damage if the calculated damage (rolled damage 
        plus modifiers) is less than one.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">One disadvantage with practice foils, however, is 
        that they must be treated delicately or they risk being bent or having 
        the tip broken off -- at which point they can become as deadly as a regular 
        rapier. Whenever a critical threat is rolled it means that the attacker 
        has used an excessive level of force. As a result, such a blow will always 
        do a minimum of one point of subdual damage, even when the calculated 
        damage does turn out to be less than one.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">In addition, whether or not the threat is turned 
        into a critical hit, there is a chance that the force will bend the blade 
        and deform or even break it, making the weapon less useful for practice 
        purposes until the problem is fixed. There is even a chance of doing real 
        damage (instead of subdual damage) to an opponent. To determine the results, 
        compare the unadjusted critical roll to <i>Table A: Practice Foil Critical 
        Roll Results</i> below.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">In the rare situation when a rogue chooses to use 
        her sneak attack capability while wielding a practice foil, she will normally 
        get her usual sneak attack damage as subdual damage. However, whenever 
        the attack results in any kind of real damage, the sneak attack damage 
        will also be real.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">It is possible to eliminate the chance of accidentally 
        bending or breaking a practice foil if the attacker is extra cautions 
        when using the weapon. This is accomplished by treating the weapon as 
        if it were a regular rapier being used to subdue. In other words, the 
        attacker takes a &#8212;4 penalty to his attack. When this is done, all damage 
        will be subdual, and critical threats are simply ignored (i.e., no critical 
        roll is made).</p>
      <pre><b>Table A:  Practice Foil Critical Roll Results</b>
Critical
  Roll    Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-5      Foil bends, but springs back to original line
 6-10     Foil deforms slightly, can be straightened manually with a
          successful strength check vs DC10.  Can be used without 
          straightening, but attacker suffers -1 to attack.
11-19     Foil deforms significantly, can be straightened only by a
          trained weaponsmith or the use of the "mending" cantrip.  Is 
          very difficult to use if not straightened -- attacker suffers 
          -4 to attack.
  20      Foil bends and the tip snaps off.  Any damage done by this
          blow will be real damage instead of subdual damage.  Tip can
          only be properly re-attached by use of the "mending" cantrip
          as it would be cheaper to buy a new one than pay to have the
          tip properly reforged by a weaponsmith.  Additionally, though
          the weapon will be several inches shorter than normal, the
          basic line of the blade will still be functionally straight.
          Any future attacks made with such a damaged weapon will cause
          1d4 points of /real/ damage (the jagged edge creates extra
          resistance, slowing the blade more than that of a regular
          rapier but also rending the flesh more).  The attacker also
          suffers -1 to his attack because of the irregular length of
          the weapon.

      <p class="first-indent"><a name="Gaff(Hook)"></a><b>Gaff (hook):</b> The 
        gaff is a metal hook with a sharp tip and a wooden or metal crossbar at 
        the base; it's held in one hand, the hook protruding between the middle 
        and ring fingers. Normally used to latch onto an object, usually for the 
        purposes of moving it, butchers use two together to move slabs of meat, 
        farmers use two together to move bales of hay, and sailors use one or 
        two to move cargo around the ship's hold. Like the belaying pin, they 
        are in fairly ready supply on board any ship.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">You can use the gaff to make trip attacks. If you 
        are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop a gaff to avoid 
        being tripped.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Sailors who have lost a hand will often use a &quot;stump 
        hook&quot; -- a leather cup with a gaff attached to it -- to replace the 
        missing hand and so that they will always have a weapon "on hand". In 
        such a case, the weapon can't be dropped or disarmed. However, if the 
        &quot;stump hook&quot; is worn on the sailor's off hand, treat it exactly 
        as any off hand weapon would be treated. For the purposes of two weapon 
        fighting, a &quot;stump hook&quot; is always considered light.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="GaffPole"></a>Gaff, pole:</b> The original 
        pole gaff was invented by fishermen who took a standard gaff, attached 
        it to a long pole, and used it to help lift heavy catches from the water.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">This weapon has reach. You can strike opponents 
        10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">You can use the pole gaff to make trip attacks. 
        If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the pole 
        gaff to avoid being tripped.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Hook:</b> See <a href="#Gaff(Hook)">Gaff (Hook)</a>.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Knife"></a>Knife:</b> The knife is just 
        that -- a standard knife with a sharp blade, normally used to carve meat 
        from a haunch when eating, gut fish, etc. Not nearly as efficient in combat 
        as a dagger, sometimes it's the only weapon available.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> Any character with proficiency using a standard 
        dagger also has proficiency with the knife.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="MainGauche"></a>Main gauche:</b> The 
        main gauche is a special kind of dagger often used in conjunction with 
        the <a href="#RapierDarokin">Darokin rapier</a>, though it can be used 
        with other weapons as well (including, of course, the standard rapier). 
        It is most often a left handed dagger (i.e., designed to be used in the 
        off-hand of the majority of individuals) and is frequently used as a defensive 
        weapon to parry and block an opponent&#8217;s weapon. It is double edged with 
        a sturdy crossbar to protect the hand and a knuckleguard that is triangular 
        in shape and often lavishly engraved. This knuckleguard grants a +1 bonus 
        against any disarm attempt made by an opponent, but its extra weight makes 
        this weapon too unbalanced for throwing.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">When using a main gauche, the wielder may choose 
        to give up his normal attack in any round in exchange for using the weapon 
        for defensive purposes only. This grants an effective +1 armour bonus 
        to AC versus all attacks in the subsequent round except missiles (i.e., 
        arrows, crossbow bolts, etc.). This bonus to AC is immediately lost if 
        the weapon is dropped for any reason.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">When the main gauche is used as a second weapon, 
        all standard two weapon penalties and fighting feats apply to both weapons 
        as usual, even when the main gauche is being used defensively.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">If you use a main gauche in each hand, and choose 
        to use a Total Defense action (see <i>Player's Handbook</i>, page 127), 
        the AC bonus from each weapon also applies and stacks, resulting in an 
        effective +2 armour bonus to AC versus all attacks except missiles.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"></p>
      <p class="first-indent">A character who is proficient with the dagger but 
        does not have proficiency with the main gauche can use this weapon as 
        if it were a standard dagger that can not be thrown. He also gains the 
        +1 bonus against disarm attempts made by an opponent due to the knuckleguard, 
        but will not be able to use it defensively for an added bonus to AC.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Note that for Rogues the weapon proficiency &quot;dagger 
        (any type)&quot; includes full proficiency with main gauche.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="RapierDarokin"></a>Rapier, Darokin:</b> Identical in practically 
        every respect to the standard rapier, this weapon has an intricately worked 
        wire-basket hilt which serves as added protection for the hand. This hilt 
        grants a +1 bonus against any disarm attempt made by an opponent. Unfortunately 
        its wire basket style makes it unsuitable for use as a gauntlet punch. 
      </p>
      <p class="first-indent">The Darokin Rapier is only made in the Republic 
        of Darokin and only by specially accredited members of the Darokin Weaponsmiths' 
        Guild. They are made primarily for the Darokinian Army and senior members 
        of the Darokin Diplomatic Corps who have training in combat as well as 
        diplomacy, although some of the more wealthy merchants of Darokin will 
        often have one specially made, with a family crest and gemwork added to 
        the hilt (these &quot;special order&quot; Darokin rapiers are usually 
        also of Masterwork quality).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> The Darokin rapier is certainly harder to come 
        by than standard rapiers, especially outside of the four central major 
        Darokinian cities (Darokin City, Athenos, Akorros and Corunglain). They 
        can usually be found for sale -- at 25% more than the base price given 
        -- in the other two major Darokin cities (Akasoli and Selenica) while 
        other places in Darokin of village size or larger may not even have a 
        single Darokin rapier for purchase and, if they do have one, it will usually 
        cost at least 50% more than the standard price. Outside of Darokin, the 
        price is highly variable, assuming such a weapon can even be found for 
        sale, as they are considered to be a &quot;collector's&quot; weapon.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Beware of less expensive weapons that <i>look</i> 
        like a Darokin rapier but are actually very clever forgeries -- they usually 
        look quite impressive but will be made of inferior grade materials, suffering 
        a -1 to damage and having a material hardness rating of only 8, with 2 
        hp. In addition, whenever the +1 due to the wire-basket hilt is the only 
        thing that has stopped you from being disarmed when wielding one of these 
        forgeries, there is a 50% chance that the wire-basket hit will suffer 
        damage severe enough to make it useless against future disarm attempts 
        and inflicting a -1 circumstance penalty to your attack roll (this is 
        due to the awkwardness of holding the weapon given the the deformation 
        of the basket).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"></p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Sabre"></a>Sabre:</b> Single edged, 
        slightly curved, and sharpened on the convex edge, the saber is primarily 
        a slashing weapon but can also be thrust. Like the cutlass, it has a heavy 
        iron basket hilt.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">The hilt can be used as a "gauntlet punch" in close 
        quarters and also grants a +1 bonus against any disarm attempt made by 
        an opponent.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (see <i>Player's 
        Handbook</i>, page 86) to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your 
        strength modifier to attack rolls with a Sabre, so long as it can be used 
        one handed.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Stiletto"></a>Stiletto:</b> The stiletto 
        is a thrusting dagger first developed in Thyatis. The entire weapon is 
        usually forged of a single piece of steel. The blade is long, narrow, 
        and triangular or rectangular sectioned without a cutting edge. Adept 
        at inflicting deep puncture wounds and even piercing light armor, the 
        stiletto is a popular secondary weapon for soldiers and citizens alike. 
        The stiletto is particularly popular among assassins because of its narrow 
        width and ease of concealment.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> Due to the shape of the blade, the stiletto has 
        a +2 attack bonus when used versus plate mail, ring mail, and chain mail, 
        but it is not balanced for throwing.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Any character with proficiency using a standard 
        dagger also has proficiency with the stiletto.</p>
