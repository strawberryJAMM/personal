      <!-- #BeginEditable "EquipmentDescriptions" -->
      <p class="first-indent"><a name="Backpack"></a><b>Backpack, standard </b> 
        A leather pack carried on the back, typically with straps to secure it. 
        The medium size version is generally 2' wide by 2' tall by 1' deep, and 
        the small version is 1' in all directions.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><a name="BackpackExplorer"></a><b>Backpack, explorers:</b> 
        The explorer's backpack is similar to the standard backpack, except that 
        it has wooden struts that provide it with extra support for carrying extra 
        weight and also has external pockets that allow for the storage and quick 
        access of some items.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">In addition, an explorer's backpack has several 
        extra leather loops and ties attached to it's exterior that make it easy 
        to attach extra gear (such as bedrolls, ropes, picks, hammers, waterbags, 
        lanterns, etc.) to the outside of the pack. Because of this, in addition 
        to it's listed weight capacity, an explorer's backpack can also accommodate 
        the following extra weight capcity hung off of its exterior: medium size 
        -- 40&nbsp;lb.; small size --10 lb.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> The size for an explorer's backpack is the same 
        as a standard backpack of the same kind (i.e., regular (medium) size is 
        2' wide by 2' tall by 1' deep, and small is 1' in all directions). The 
        extra weight capacity of these packs is accounted for by the exterior 
        pockets. A medium size version, has two pockets, one above the other, 
        on each side of the pack that are each 8&quot; wide by 10&quot; tall by 
        6&quot; deep, with a 5&nbsp;lb. weight capacity, and a larger pocket across 
        the back of the pack that is 20&quot; wide by 18&quot; tall by 6&quot; 
        deep with a 10&nbsp;lb. weight capacity. A small size version has three 
        pockets, one each on the left, right and back of the pack, that are each 
        8&quot; wide by 10&quot; tall by 6&quot; deep, with a 5&nbsp;lb. weight 
        capacity.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><a name="BackpackWaterproof"></a><b>Backpack, waterproof:</b> 
        A waterproof backpack is essentially a standard backpack that has been 
        made with extra layers of leather and thourougly treated with a waterproofing 
        agent such as bee's wax. As a result, the entire bag may be completly 
        submerged in water for a period of an hour before it's contents will start 
        to suffer water damage (assuming that all the openings were tightly secured 
        before the submerging took place). In addition, a waterproof backpack 
        will always shrug off an ordinary rain shower, and can even keep it's 
        contents dry for at least 6 hours when subjected to a torrential downpour.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">The exterior dimensions of a waterproof backpack 
        are the same as a standard backpack of the same kind (i.e., regular (medium) 
        size is 2' wide by 2' tall by 1' deep, and small is 1' in all directions). 
        However, because of the extra material used to making it waterproof, the 
        interior volume is reduced to three-quarters of a standard backpack, resulting 
        in the interior dimensions of approximate 18&quot;x18&quot;x9&quot;.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Barrel"></a>Barrel:</b> A typical barrel 
        with wooden slats held together with iron rings.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Basket"></a>Basket:</b> An open woven basket with a sturdy 
        handle, these containers are usually woven out of dried plant materials, 
        and can not be used to carry liquids. The large basket is usually a rectangular 
        shape that is 2' wide by 1' long and 1' deep while the small basket is 
        usually a square shape 1' in all directions</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> A cotton &quot;basket cloth&quot; that has extra 
        material at the corners that can be tied together over the contents of 
        the basket can also be purchased at an additional 3&nbsp;sp for a large 
        basket and a 1&nbsp;sp for a small basket.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Beltpouch"></a></b><b>Bucket:</b> Typical 
        metal bucket with a curved metal handle that has a piece of wood in the 
        middle to protect the hand when carrying a full load.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Chest"></a>Chest:</b> Typical wooden 
        chest with metal reenforcing. The approximate dimensions for each size 
        category are: large - 5'x3'x2'; medium - 4'x2'x1'; and small 2'x1'x'1. 
        A chest may either be secured using an external pad lock or may have a 
        lock included as part of the construction. When a lock is included, add 
        1/2 the price of a lock of the same quality to the cost of the chest. 
        See <i>Player's Handbook</i>, p108 for full details on lock quality and 
        prices.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Sack"></a>Pouch, belt:</b> As described 
        in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, p 109. The typical dimensions for a medium 
        beltpouch is 5&quot; wide by 6&quot; tall and 1&quot; thick, while a small 
        beltpouch is 2.5&quot; by 3&quot; and 1&quot; thick.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Bucket"></a></b><b>Sack:</b> Typical 
        burlap sack. A large sack is approximately 2' wide by 3' long by 6&quot; 
        deep and a small sack is approximately 1' wide by 2' long by 6&quot; deep.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Saddlebags"></a>Saddlebags:</b> This 
        is a long, two pocketed leather container that lies behind the saddle. 
        Long saddlebags are designed for horses and similar riding animals, while 
        short ones are designed for shorter riding animals such as ponys, etc. 
        Each pocket has an opening that is roughly 1' square, regardless of length. 
        Long saddlebags are roughly 45&quot; long, while short saddlebags are 
        roughly 27&quot; long</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="SailorsDuffel"></a>Sailor's duffel:</b> 
        A sailor's duffel is a container that is frequently available in port 
        cities and is ubiquitous among professional sailors. It is essentially 
        a duffel bag with a single opening along most of its length, and two long 
        straps to either side of this opening. The opening consists of about 6&quot; 
        of overlapping material that can be held closed with a series of large 
        buttons. It is a move equivalent action to open or close all the buttons. 
        The medium size duffel is 5' long by 1' wide and 1' deep and the small 
        size duffel is 4' long by 8&quot; wide and 8&quot; deep.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">The duffel itself is made of sail canvas that has 
        been treated to make it slightly water resistant. This allows the duffel 
        to keep it's contents dry in stormy weather for up to an hour and light 
        rain for up to four hours.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Unlike a backpack, a sailor's duffel is somewhat 
        awkward to use when adventuring as it must be carried in one hand at the 
        side, or over one shoulder using one hand (-1 circumstance penalty to 
        all physical actions) or carried on the back by putting the straps over 
        the shoulders as if it were a backpack (-2 circumstance penalty to physical 
        actions, due to the awkward placement of the weight, but both hands are 
        free).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="Satchel"></a>Satchel:</b> A squarish 
        leather bag with a flap to close it. It is sometimes designed to sit on 
        a belt in a maner similar to that of a belt pouch, but more often it has 
        an adjustable strap that goes over the head and allows the bag to hang 
        at the hip on the opposite side of the body from the shoulder that the 
        strap rests on. The medium satchel is typically 12&quot; wide by 18&quot; 
        long and 4&quot; thick, while the small satchel is typically 9&quot; wide 
        by 12&quot; long and 2&quot; thick.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><a name="SpellComponentPouch"></a>Spell component 
        pouch:</b> As described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, p&nbsp;111. Each 
        of the many small compartments are of a variety of different sizes, suitable 
        for most standard spell components. Spellcasting characters will generally 
        need only worry about the volume and weight capacity of this container 
        if they are carrying a large number of &quot;exotic&quot; spell components 
        (i.e., ones that are very expensive and/or very difficult to obtain).</p>
