      <p>This file describes each new or non-core skill used in my campaign in 
        a format similar to that used in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, and also 
        describes house-rule modifications to core skills where necessary. Like 
        the entries in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, the descriptions include 
        common uses and typical modifiers.</p>

      <h3><span class="small-caps"><a name="AquaticAnimalEmpathy"></a>Aquatic 
        Animal Empathy</span> <span class="smaller">(Cha; Trained Only; Sea Ranger 
        Only)</span></h3>
      <p>Use this skill to improve the attitude of any aquatic animal or beast. 
      </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Check:</b> As standard Animal Empathy skill except 
        that the character gains a +2 competency bonus when the skill is used 
        against aquatic/water animals/beasts and suffers a -2 competency penalty 
        when this skill is used against animals/beasts from a dry-land environment. 
        No bonus or penalty applies when dealing with any avian or animals/beasts 
        from a semi-aquatic environment (shorelines, small islands, swamps, etc.). 
      </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Special:</b> Having 5 or more ranks in Animal 
        Empathy grants a +2 synergy bonus to Aquatic Animal Empathy. </p>
      <p class="first-indent"> Having 5 or more ranks in Aquatic Animal Empathy 
        grants a +2 synergy bonus to Animal Empathy when used in a semi-aquatic 
        environment. </p>
      <p class="first-indent"> When you have ranks in both Aquatic Animal Empathy 
        and Animal Empathy you may choose to use whichever skill grants the better 
        total modifier in any situation. </p>
      <h3><span class="small-caps"><a name="AquaticRide"></a>Aquatic Ride</span> 
        <span class="smaller">(Dex; Trained Only)</span></h3>
      <p>Similar to regular riding skill, but allows the character to ride a particular 
        species of water-based mount (mount must be specified when skill is taken) 
      </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Check:</b> As standard Ride skill. </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Special:</b> If a water-based mount on the surface 
        of the water is attacked, it will normally submerge unless it makes a 
        successful Will check. If the Will check fails, the rider can command 
        the mount to re-surface by making a successful Ride check. If the check 
        fails, the rider can attempt another check each round thereafter, so long 
        as he is physically able. While submerged with the mount and attempting 
        to force it to surface, the rider risks drowning (Rules for Drowning are 
        covered in the DMG).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> If you are riding bareback, you suffer a -5 penalty 
        on Aquatic Ride checks</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="#AquaticAnimalEmpathy">Handle 
        Aquatic Animal</a>, you get a +2 synergy bonus to Aquatic Ride checks. 
        If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 synergy bonus 
        to Aquatic Ride checks. These bonuses stack.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">If your mount has a military saddle (see <i>Player's 
        Handbook, </i> page 113), it gives a +2 circumstance bonus to Aquatic 
        Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">The Aquatic Ride skill may be used in place of the 
        Ride skill as a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Combat, Mounted Archery, 
        Trample, Ride-By Attack, and Spirited Charge. See the feat descriptions 
        in Chapter 5: Feats of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details. </p>
      <h3><span class="small-caps"><a name="AquaticWildernessLore"></a>Aquatic 
        Wilderness Lore</span> <span class="smaller">(Wis)</span></h3>
      <p>Use this skill to help you hunt for aquatic or semi-aquatic game, identify 
        signs that tritons or merfolk live in the region, or avoid whirlpools 
        and other natural hazards. It will also allow you to use the <a href="../feats/feats.htm#track">Track 
        feat</a> in aquatic, and coastal regions, effectively allowing you to 
        track waterborne craft, and creatures moving through the water or along 
        the seashores and small islands (see the modified version of the <a href="../feats/feats.htm#track">Track 
        feat</a> in the <a href="../feats/feats.htm">Feat file</a> for details). </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Check:</b> As standard Wilderness Lore except 
        that the character gains an additional +2 competency bonus when the skill 
        is used in a purely aquatic environment (oceans, lakes, rivers, etc.) 
        and suffers a -2 competency penalty when this skill is used in a purely 
        dry-land environment. No bonus or penalty applies when used in a semi-aquatic 
        environment (shorelines, small islands, swamps, etc.).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Special:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Intuit 
        Direction, you get a +2 synergy bonus on Aquatic Wilderness Lore checks 
        to avoid getting lost. If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="#IntuitDistance">Intuit 
        Distance</a>, you get a +2 synergy bonus on Aquatic Wilderness Lore checks 
        to avoid getting lost. These bonuses stack.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Having 5 or more ranks in Wilderness Lore grants 
        a +2 synergy bonus to Aquatic Wilderness Lore when used in a semi-aquatic 
        environment. Having 5 or more ranks in Aquatic Wilderness Lore grants 
        a +2 synergy bonus to Wilderness Lore when used in a semi-aquatic environment. 
      </p>
      <p class="first-indent">When you have ranks in both Aquatic Wilderness Lore 
        and Wilderness Lore you may choose to use whichever skill grants the better 
        total modifier in any situation. </p>
      <h3><span class="small-caps">I<a name="IntuitDistance"></a>ntuit Distance*</span> 
        <span class="smaller">(Wis)</span></h3>
      <p>You have an innate sense of the distance you have traveled. </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Check:</b> A successful check means that you 
        can estimate how far you have travelled within 10% of the actual distance. 
        The DC of the check is based on the number of days of travel for which 
        you wish to estimate the distance: DC = 10 + number of days.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Failure means you estimate the distance at 70% to 
        130% of the actual distance. The DM secretly rolls 2d4+5, multiplies by 
        10%, multiplies the actual distance by that percentage, and tells you 
        that value (Your chance of estimating the value within 10% is actually 
        fairly high even if you fail the check -- in such a case, you made a lucky 
        guess.)</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Retry:</b> Under normal circumstances, you can 
        only use Intuit Distance once per day. The roll represents how sensitive 
        you are to your speed and thus to the distance travelled that day. Additionally, 
        you can retry this skill check whenever something significant occurs that 
        would cause you to reevaluate your distance estimate. A significant occurrence 
        would be something like &quot;unexpectedly&quot; approaching a known landmark. 
        Similarly, <i>not</i> encountering a landmark when you were expecting 
        to might also allow a retry.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Special:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Intuit 
        Distance, you get a +2 synergy bonus on both Wilderness Lore and Aquatic 
        Wilderness Lore checks to avoid getting lost.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>* IMC, the <i>Intuit Distance</i> skill is considered a class skill for 
        any class that also has <i>Intuit Direction</i> as a class skill.</p>
      <h3><span class="small-caps"><a name="HandleAquaticAnimal"></a>Handle Aquatic 
        Animal</span> <span class="smaller">(Cha; Trained Only)</span></h3>
      <p>Use this skill to drive a team of dolphins or giant sea horses pulling 
        a water chariot, to teach a dogfish to guard, or to raise an otter as 
        a pet. </p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Check:</b> As standard Handle Animal skill except 
        that the character gains a +2 competency bonus when the skill is used 
        against animals/beasts from a purely-aquatic environment (oceans, lakes, 
        rivers, etc.) and suffers a -2 competency penalty when this skill is used 
        against animals/beasts from a dry-land environment. No bonus or penalty 
        applies when dealing with any avian or animals/beasts from a semi-aquatic 
        environment (shorelines, small islands, swamps, etc.).</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Special:</b> An untrained character can use a 
        Charisma check to handle and push aquatic animals.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">A character with 5 or more ranks of Aquatic Animal 
        Empathy gets a +2 synergy bonus on Handle Aquatic Animal checks with animals 
        found in an aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. A character must have 
        9 or more ranks of Aquatic Animal Empathy to get the same +2 synergy bonus 
        on Handle Aquatic Animal checks with beasts found in an aquatic or semi-aquatic 
        environment.</p>
