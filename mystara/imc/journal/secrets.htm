      <p class="first-indent">Some pages in the <b>Campaign Journal</b> section 
        of this site contain <i class="redfont">secrets</i>.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><i class="redfont">Secrets</i> are bits of campaign-related 
        information that are not generally known by all (or even any) of the players 
        (or their characters) in this campaign. As a result, I have set this area 
        up so that every <i class="redfont">secret</i> is associated with at least 
        one keyword. <i class="redfont">Secrets</i> will only be visible in a 
        browser where at least one of the associated keywords has been entered 
        in any one of the &quot;locks&quot; found throughout this section (basically 
        a web form where you can enter keyword text). This makes it possible to 
        restrict the access of the players in the campagin to only those <i class="redfont">secrets</i> 
        that their characters would actually be aware of.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">For anyone who is not a player in the campaign and 
        who does have an interest in all the background and juicy details found 
        in my campaign, there is one &quot;master keyword&quot; which will unlock 
        every single <i class="redfont">secret</i> in this site. If you would 
        like to be able to gain access to all the <i class="redfont">secrets</i> 
        on this site, just send a blank email to <a href="mailto:imc@jamm.com?Subject=%27Guest%20Access%20Request%20for%20strawberryJAMMs%20Mystara%20Campaign">imc@jamm.com</a> 
        and you will receive the &quot;master keyword&quot; that will unlock all 
        the <i class="redfont">secrets</i>.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Note:</b> In order to actually use a keyword 
        to gain access to these <i class="redfont">secrets</i>, you must have 
        your browser set to accept cookies.</p>
