      <!-- #BeginEditable "Introduction" -->
      <p>The water elves of Minrothad have developed into a distinctive subculture, 
        and are recognized as a group separate from the mainstream elven race 
        of Mystara. In this regard, they are similar to the shadow elves of the 
        Broken Lands, to whom they bear a physical resemblance that many <a href="elves.htm">other 
        elves</a> find unsettling.</p>
      <!-- #EndEditable -->
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Personality:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Personality" -->A 
        water elf's first love is the sea. He is fascinated by its ever-changing 
        moods and excited by the challenges it constantly presents to the seafarer. 
        His curiosity is piqued by its water mysteries; a water elf loves to travel 
        on the ocean and learn about the creatures in it, and often masters magic 
        which deals specifically with the sea and weather.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "PersonalityExtra" -->
      <p class="first-indent">Water elves were the first inhabitants of the Minrothad 
        Isles to explore the local waters thoroughly. They were the first to develop 
        moveable rigging on sailing craft so that a vessel could sail close to 
        the wind and maneuver with ease. They continue to innovate and improve 
        their sailing vessels, giving the merchant fleet of the Minrothad Guilds 
        its justly-deserved reputation as the finest and swiftest in the known 
        world.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">This avid interest in the ocean and ways to travel 
        upon it have made the water elves one of the driving forces of the Minrothad 
        Guilds. It was their seafaring knowledge and wanderlust combined with 
        the human interest in trade that enabled the Minrothad Guilds to expand 
        and dominate sea-going commerce.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Always anxious to travel, water elves are excited 
        by new sights, new lands, and new prospects for trade. They are happy 
        to arrive at a destination, and are equally happy to leave it for some 
        place new, providing the traveling is done by sea or river. More than 
        half of the Minrothad traders encountered in continental ports are water 
        elves, as are many of the merchant-prince ship captains, but these elves 
        do not care to be factors or guild representatives permanently posted 
        in a foreign city.</p>

      <p class="first-indent"><b>Physical Description:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Physical" -->Water 
        elves are towed-headed or have light blond hair that bleaches almost white 
        in the sun. Their eyes are blue-gray and their complexions are pale in 
        spite of constant exposure to weather and sun. They have a faint resemblance 
        to the Alfheim elves, but look even more like shadow elves because of 
        their coloration.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

      <p class="first-indent"><b>Religion:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Religion" -->The 
        primary religion of the water elf clans is known as &quot;Elendaen&quot;, 
        which means &quot;The Ocean Path&quot;. This philosophy honors Calitha 
        Starbrow, a water elf from ancient times who ascended to immortality in 
        the sphere of Time. She is especial fond of the water. She taught water 
        elves the art of seafaring and led them to their home in Minrothad.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "ReligionExtra" -->
      <p class="first-indent">Adherents of Elendaen believe the ocean is the cradle 
        of all life, for even trees thrive on the rain from storms that form over 
        the sea. Elendaen followers desire to exploit the land and sea wisely 
        so they may continue to prosper.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Keepers and others dedicated to Elendaen wear only 
        garments and accessories derived from products of the sea.</p>

      <h3><!-- #BeginEditable "Race2" -->Elven<!-- #EndEditable --> Racial Traits</h3>
      <ul>
        <!-- #BeginEditable "Traits" -->
        <li>+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Strength, -2 Constitution: Water 
          elves, slighter of build than <a href="elves.htm">other elves</a>, 
          favour intellectual elegance and physical agility over brute strength. </li>
        <li>Medium size: As Medium-size creatures, elves have no special bonuses 
          or penalties due to their size.</li>
        <li>Elven base speed is 30 feet.</li>
        <li>Low-light Vision: Water elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
          moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. 
          The retain the ability to distinguish colour and detail under these 
          conditions.</li>
        <li>+2 racial saving throw bonus against all Enchantment spells or effects.<br>
          <i><span class="smaller">(Note the <b>lack</b> of an immunity to magic </span></i><span class="smaller">sleep<i> spells and effects. Mystaran 
          water elves also lack the ability to </i>trance<i> for only four hours 
          and must sleep a full eight hours like all other common races.)</i></span></li>
        <li>+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks. Any water elf who 
          merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled 
          to a Search check to notice it as if he were actively looking for the 
          door. And elf's senses are so keen that he practically has a sixth sense 
          about hidden portals.</li>
        <li>+2 racial bonus on Swim checks. Water elves spend so much of their 
          time near, in and on the water, they gained additional competency with 
          this skill as a means of survival.</li>
        <li>Navigation Sense: Water elves have developed an uncanny natural sense 
          of direction. As a result, a water elf is able to know in what direction 
          a destination lies in relation to his current position, providing he 
          has been to that place at least once before. For this reason it is said 
          that once a water elf has been to a port, he can always find his way 
          back again. Navigation Sense works in conjunction with the Intuit Direction 
          skill, which all water elves are also assumed to be trained in even 
          if they have put no extra ranks into it. To use this ability, the water 
          elf must first use Intuit Direction to to fix the direction of north 
          in relation to his current position in his mind. If successful, there 
          is then a 75% chance that he can correctly identify the direction of 
          the destination in question. If this percentage roll fails, the water 
          elf is simply unable to get a &quot;fix&quot; on the direction to the 
          destination. Navigation Sense can only be used once per destination.</li>
        <li>Proficient with either longsword, <a href="../equipment/weapons.htm#RapierDarokin">rapier</a> or <a href="../equipment/weapons.htm#Sabre">sabre</a>. 
          Despite their shift from the woodlands to the seas, water elves still 
          esteem the art of swordplay, so all water elves are familiar with at 
          least one &quot;respectable&quot; bladed weapon. However, they no longer 
          place any great emphasis on the so-called &quot;art of archery&quot; 
          and, unlike members of the mainstream elven race, do not spend extra 
          effort on learning to use long bows and short bows.</li>
        <li>Water elves with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher may cast the 
          0-level spells (cantrips) <i>detect magic</i>, <i>prestidigitation</i>, 
          and <i><a href="../spells/spells.htm">sea legs</a></i> each once per 
          day. These are arcane spells, and as such the elf suffers spell failure 
          penalties for wearing armour. Treat the elf as a 1st-level caster for 
          all spell effects dependent on level. For <i>detect magic</i> and <i>prestidigitation</i>, 
          see the spell descriptions in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more 
          details. For <i><a href="../spells/spells.htm">sea legs</a></i>, see 
          the <a href="../spells/spells.htm">Spells File</a> for details.</li>
        <li>Automatic Languages: Local Regional Language, Local Common (if different 
          from Local Regional Language) and Elven. Bonus Languages: Additional 
          Regional Languages, {etc... } </li>
        <li>Favoured Class: Wizard. A multiclass water elf's wizard class does 
          not count when determining whether she suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing 
          (see &quot;Experience for Multiclass Characters&quot;, <i>Player's Handbook</i>, 
          page 56). Wizardry comes as naturally to water elves as to regular elves, 
          although they are far more interested in weather and water magic than 
          other elves. As with <a href="elves.htm">other elves</a>, Fighter/Wizards 
          are a common combination among water elves, although Rogue/Wizards are 
          also popular because of their natural inclination to follow the carefree 
          life of the sailor. </li>
