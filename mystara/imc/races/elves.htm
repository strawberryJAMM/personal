      <!-- #BeginEditable "Introduction" --> 
      <p>Mystaran elves mingle freely with the other races throughout the Known 
        world. They are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and, especially, 
        their magical arts -- in Mystara, everyone &quot;knows&quot; that even 
        the lowliest elf is capable of arcane spellcasting. Most elves favour 
        things of natural and simple beauty, although there are some Mystaran 
        societies where elves have come to not only understand but respect and 
        pursue the materialistic and complicated ways of humans, such as those 
        found in Darokin. Whenever danger threatens them and theirs, whether they 
        are in the woodland homes of their traditional lands or the towns and 
        cities of their adopted homes, they quickly reveal a strong martial streak, 
        demonstrating skill with sword, bow and battle strategy.</p>
      <!-- #EndEditable --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Personality:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Personality" -->Elves 
        are more often amused than excited, more liekly to be curious than greedy. 
        With such long lives, they tend to keep a broad perspective on events, 
        remaining aloof and unfazed by petty hapenstance. When pursuing a goal, 
        however, whether an adventurious mission or learning a new skill or art, 
        they can be focused and relentless. The are slow to make friends and enemies, 
        and even slower to forget them. The reply to petty insults with disdain 
        and to serious insults with vengeance.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

      <!-- #EndEditable --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Physical Description:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Physical" -->The 
        elves of Mystara are short and slim, standing about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet 
        tall and typically weighing 85 to 135 pounds, with elven men the same 
        height as and only marginally heavier than elven women.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "PhysicalExtra" --> 
      <p class="first-indent"> The elves of Mystara have delicate features and 
        pointed ears and are generally fair-skinned and fair-haired; they tan 
        lightly and never sunburn.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> In general, elves prefer simple, comfortable clothes, 
        especially in pastel blues and greens, and they enjoy simple yet elegant 
        jewelry. Elves possess unearthly grace and fine features. Many humans 
        and members of other races find them hauntingly beautiful.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Elves live naturally to between 400 and 600 years 
        old. A very few have reached 800 years old; and more have died of disease 
        or violent deaths before their 500th birthday. They take about 20 years 
        to grow to full size, then have a free-spirited &quot;adolescence&quot; 
        of about 80 years. It is during this time that an elf chooses whether 
        to remain in the forests of her birth or follow the wandering path of 
        the adventurer.</p>
      <!-- #EndEditable --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Relations:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Relations" -->Elves 
        relate to the other common races in the following ways:<!-- #EndEditable --></p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "RelationsExtra" --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Dwarves.</i></b> Elves do not understand the 
        dwarven work ethic or the dwarven need to create only things that last, 
        just as the dwarves cannot comprehend the elven need for the emphermeral 
        pleasures of hunting and playing. In essence, there exists between elf 
        and dwarf a deep misunderstanding resulting from total racial incompatibility.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Gnomes.</i></b> To elves, gnomes are more 
        reasonable than dwarves. Gnomes like the forest, work with things other 
        than rock and metal, have a lot of imagination, and a sense of humor. 
        Moreover, gnomish inventions never fail to fascinate and amuse the elves... 
        even if they don't always work.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Halflings (Hin).</i></b> If there is a race 
        that the elves truly like, it is the halflings. The short folk seem to 
        have an elf-like joie-de-vivre, even without having elf-like lives. True, 
        the halflings are entirely too tied up in taming the land rather than 
        living with it, but that is obviously the influence of the humans. If 
        halflings had the proper influence of elves around, they would probably 
        be good foresters. It's a pity about that human influence though.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Humans.</i></b> Elves are often in awe of 
        humans. That short-lived beings can achieve such skills with magic and 
        weapons amazes the elves. yet it is amazement mixed with fear, for the 
        elves still remember tales of Blackmoor, of wrongful technology ... and 
        the punishment of the Rain of Fire, all brought on by humans. It happened 
        once, it will happen again.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Humans now like to think of elves as their friends. 
        yet given the choice, [most] elves would choose not to deal with humans. 
        When they do deal with humans, they are often aloof, distant, even insulting, 
        expressing pity in a negative way; attitudes which mask the elven fear 
        and distrust of this prolific, powerful, and unpredictable race.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Orcs.</i></b> Orcs hate elves, elves hate 
        orcs (though the cosmopolitan elves of Alfheim Town have learned to telerate 
        what they think of as &quot;their&quot; orcs). Records in the Mealidor 
        Library suggest that the mutal hatred predates even the oral tradition 
        of history.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Wherever elves go, it seems that orcs soon follow 
        (or vice versa). Some scholars believe the orc/elf struggle may have cosmic 
        significance. In all likelihood, the truth lies buried under the southern 
        polar ice cap in what was once Evergrun, the elven homeland.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Half-Orcs.</i> </b>When Mystaran elves encounter 
        half-orcs in civilized regions, they regard them with unrelenting suspicion. 
        Half-orcs raised among their orcish relations are reviled and hated as 
        much as their orc parent would be.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"><b><i>Half-Elves.</i></b> Most Mystaran elves consider 
        half-elves to be a figure of legend. These fabled creatures are thought 
        to have all the benefits of both elf and man, with none of the problems.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">In truth, throughout most of the Mystaran continent 
        of Brun, in the area identified as &quot;The Known World&quot;, the true 
        half-elf is virtually unknown. Occationally, there are elf-human matings. 
        Apparently the two races are sufficiently similar to be interfertile. 
        However, the product of such unions are either elves or men, though their 
        outward appearances sometimes fool watchers.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">As far as can be told, the elven traits are inherited 
        through the femal line. The product of a union between human female and 
        male elf is always human. Moreover, the male children are always stilborn.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">When female elf mates with male human, the male 
        children are always elves, the female children always human.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Of course, all of these female &quot;human&quot; 
        children have the potential for growing up to bear elf or human children 
        of either sex, depending on the genetic make up of their partner.</p>
      <!-- #EndEditable --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Alignment:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Alignment" -->Elves 
        love freedom, variety, and self-expression. They lean strongly toward 
        the gentler aspects of chaos. Generally, they value and protect others' 
        freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. <!-- #EndEditable --></p>

      <p class="first-indent"><b>Religion:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Religion" -->Most 
        elven religious life among the elves in Alfheim is tied to the worship 
        of the first elven Immortal, Ilsundal. Some elves, especially in the Mealidil 
        clan, extend their worship to Mealiden, who followed Ilsundal's path to 
        Immortality.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "ReligionExtra" --> 
      <p class="first-indent">Other Immortals favored by elves throughout the

        most elves in a single clan or group follow the same Immortal.</p>
      <p class="first-indent"> Since most elves practice arcane magic rather than 
        divine magic, many elves see no need for any patron Immortal.</p>
      <!-- #EndEditable --> 
      <p class="first-indent"><b>Language:</b> <!-- #BeginEditable "Language" -->All 
        Mystaran elves speak a single common elven language, a fluid language 
        of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Slight differences in dialect 
        reveal the origin of the speaker but do not interfere with mutual understanding.

      <!-- #BeginEditable "LanguageExtra" --> 
      <p class="first-indent">While Elven literature is rich and varied, it is

        Elven so they can add Elven ballads to their repertoires. Others simply 
        memorize Elven songs by sound. The Elven script, as flowing as the spoken 
        word, also serves as the script for Sylvan, the language of dryads and

        that elves dislike: regimented from day to day but changing from decade 
        to decade. Elves among humans, therefore, find careers that allow them 
        to wander freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy demonstrating 
        their prowess with the sword and bow or gaining greater magical powers, 
        and adventuring allows them to do so. Good elves may also be rebels or 
        crusaders.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

        <li>Elves with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher may cast the 0-level 
          spells (cantrips) <i>daze</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>prestidigitation</i>, 
          each once per day. These are arcane spells, and as such the elf suffers 
          spell failure penalties for wearing armour. Treat the elf as a 1st-level 
          caster for all spell effects dependent on level. See the spell descriptions 
          in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more details.</li>
        <li>Low-light Vision: Elves can see twice as far as a human in starlight,

      <p class="first-indent"> Elves mature at the same rate as humans up to the 
        age of 6. This slows to 2/3rds of the human maturation rate until they 
        reach their early 40's when they are roughly as mature and as capable 
        as any human at age 30. At this point their maturation rate slows yet 
        again, so much, in fact, that to a casual, non-elf, observer, they do 
        not appear to age at all for more than 300 years. Around the age of 350 
        years they are, in fact, similar in maturity and physical capability to 
        humans in their early 40's. At this point, their aging rate actually increases 
        again, but only to 1/5th that of human maturation rates. As a result, 
        it isn't until roughtly the age of 500 years that they become as venerable 
        as a 70 year old human.</p>
      <p class="first-indent">Although female elves can actually bear children 
        from about the age of 17, most elves do not begin breeding until well 
        after their mid-40's, when their "slowing" has taken hold. They may have 
        several children over their life, but they will rarely be closer than 
        20 years apart, and <i>never</i> less than 10 years apart. Additionally, 
        most elf couples will usually stay together for a period of between 40 
        and 60 years and then agree to break off their long term relation ship 
        and take their lives in separate directions. As a result, most elves will 
        have at least two, if not three or four significant, long term, relationships 
        during their lives and it is not at all uncommon for a given elf to have 
        several step-siblings and half-siblings as well as (or even instead of) 
        full-blood siblings. Note that this practice of "mutual separation" is 
        seen as perfectly normal behaviour among almost all elf communities, and 
        it is often pointed out to those who chastise elves for their tendency 
        toward "infidelity" that elves of both sexes frequently stay with each 
        one of their many long-term partners longer than many human marriages 
        even last.</p>
