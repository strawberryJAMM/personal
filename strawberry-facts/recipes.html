<P>Provided By: Jenni A. M. Merrifield<BR> Originally From: Better Homes And

Gardens New Cookbook, 1981, p. 280

</P>

<PRE>Pie Ingredients:

  - 1-1/4 cp. sugar

  - 3 tbsp. quick cooking tapioca

  - 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg

  - 3 cp. rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

  - 2 cp. sliced, fresh strawberries

  - Pastry for Double-Crust Pie (see below)

  - 2 tbsp. butter

Oven Temp:  375 degrees F.</PRE>

<P>Stir together sugar, tapioca, nutmeg and dash of <EM>salt</EM>.   Mix

rhubarb pieces and strawberry slices together.  Add sugar mixture to rhubarb and

strawberries; toss to coat fruit.  Let fruit mixture stand for 15 minutes.  Fill

a pastry-lined 9&quot; pie plate with fruit mixture; dot with butter.  Adjust

top crust.  Seal and flute edge.  Cover edge of pie with foil.  Bake in a 375

degree F.  oven for 25 minutes.  Remove foil and bake for 25 minutes more or

till golden.  Server Warm, plain or with vanilla ice cream.   Makes 8 servings.

</P>

<PRE>Double-Crust Pastry Ingredients: (p 288)

  - 2 cp. all purpose flour

  - 1 tsp. salt

  - 2/3 cp. shortening or lard

  - 6 to 7 tbsp. cold water</PRE>

<P>In a mixing bowl stir together flour and salt.  Cut in shortening or lard

until pieces are the size of small peas.  Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of the water over

part of the mixture; gently toss with a fork.  Push to side of bowl.  Repeat

till all is moistened.  

</P>

<P>Divide dough into two parts, forming each into a ball.  On a lightly floured

surface, take one of the halves and flatten the dough with  hands.  Roll dough

from centre to edge, forming a circle about 12 inches in diameter.  Wrap pastry

around rolling pin.  Unroll onto a 9&quot; pie plate.  Ease pastry into pie

plate, being careful no to stretch pastry.  Trim pastry even with rim.  For top

crust, roll out remaining dough.  Place desired pie filling (i.e.

strawberry-rhubarb filling) into pie shell.  Top with  pastry for top crust. 

Trim top crust 1/2-inch beyond edge of pie plate.   Fold extra pastry under

bottom crust; flute edge.  Cut slits into the top crust to allow steam to escape

while cooking.  Bake as directed in individual recipe.

<H3><A NAME="Wine">Strawberry Wine</A></H3>

<P>Provided by: Peter, The old strawberry grower</P>

<PRE>Ingredients:

  - 4 to 4-1/2 lbs Strawberries

 - 1 Gallon Water

 - 2 lbs. Sugar

 - 1 tsp. Acid Blend (Do Acid Test)

 - 1/8 tsp. Tannin

 - 1/2 tsp. Peptic Enzyme

 - 1 tsp. Yeast Nutrient

 - 1 Campden Tablet (plus more tablets for each rack)

 - 1 pack Cote's de Blanc Yeast</PRE>

<P>Wash and remove the stems and leaves. Use a straining bag and fill with the

strawberries.  Tie the top, commence to crushing and mashing.  Leave straining

bag in the bucket.  Add water, sugar, acid blend (do test), tannin, peptic,

enzyme, and yeast nutrient . Stir well.  Before you add the yeast, you will need

to sterilize the must.  Crush up one campden tablet and add to the must.  Stir

and cover for 24 hours.  Now you may add the yeast.  Stir well, cover and stir

every day for 4-5 days.  Then siphon into your 1 gallon jug, put rubber stopper

on and airlock.  Siphon every 2 weeks and add 1 crushed campden tablet every

time you rack.  It will take about 2-3 months before your wine is clear enough

to bottle. You can make more than one gallon if you just multiply out the recipe

to however many gallons you want to make.  One pack of yeast will work for 5-7

gallons.  <STRONG>ENJOY!</STRONG>

<H3><A NAME="GranolaYogurt">Strawberry/Fruit Granola Yogurt Dish</A></H3>

<P>Provided by: Dick McCurdy<BR><EM> I love strawberries especially, but the

wonderful flavour comes from mixing fruits.  I do not use any frozen fruits but

I recommend any of the following: Strawberries, Pineapple, 	Banana,

	Blueberries, 	Cantaloupe, 	Honeydew, Melon, 	Kiwi Fruit, 	Apple, 	Pears.  If

you use apples and/or pears, core and slice thinly (1/8-1/4 inch) and place 

around the edge of the bowl standing up.  This makes the holding capacity of 

the bowl greater! Yum-Yum!</EM></P>

<PRE>Layer the following in a soup bowl:



  -	1/2 C Vanilla yogurt

  -	1/2 C Heartland Granola

  - 1   C Mixed Fruit (cut up to spoon size)
