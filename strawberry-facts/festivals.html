remember if there's a parade or not, but there are lots of children's activities

<P>From:  <EM>Christine Shaw</EM><BR>Every year as far back as I can remember

there is a strawberry festival at the Silverton Grange Hall in the Silverton

Hills, in the heart of the strawberry  fields. It is held sometime in June.  In

the old days, the farm women would  get together and whip fresh cream, and make

fresh shortbread.  You would pay a  minimal fee, get your shortcake, sit at a

table with huge bowls of fresh  whipped cream and huge bowls of strawberries. 

Years later it wasn't quite as  rustic and fresh. Although I haven't been to one

in years,  I know some things  haven't changed: the wonderful, huge, red, juicy

strawberries, and the delightful farmer folk of the area.
