-- Wepion, Belgium</BIG></A><BR>   </DT>

<DD>From: <EM>D.J. Fouarge</EM><BR>   <TT>I come from a little place called

Wepion (in Belgium). In Wepion,    Farmers have made their speciality of growing

strawberries. I'll give the name of the plant they grow there when i have more

information about it.   The strawberries taste wonderful and fresh.  It is

actually said that Wepion is the world capital of strawberries.  One typical way

to eat strawberries is just to spread some lemon juice on top of them as well as

a little bit of fresh moulded white pepper.</TT>  

<P>From: <EM>Kalpana Shankar</EM><BR>   <TT>There also is a Strawberry

Museum in Wepion, Belgium</TT>   </P>

 </DT>

<DD>Strawberries have traditionally been a staple of the tennis fan's diet

during the time period of the Wimbledon Tennis Matches.  According to my English

Grandmother, the only reason is because Strawberries are in season at the same

time of year Wimbledon is held.  [If you ask me, that's a good enough reason as

any for a strawberry    tradition!--JAMM]

and, in the midnight sun of the north, the berries would ripen virtually 24

hours a day.</LI></UL>

NAME="Law"><BIG><STRONG>Strawberry Law</STRONG></BIG></A>   </DT>

<DD>From: <EM>Kevin McManaman</EM><BR>   <TT>For your information, I

recently read a state supreme court opinion dealing with strawberries.  Believe

it or not, the Nebraska Supreme Court very recently decided an opinion dealing

with the methods of sale for strawberries in stores.  Apparently the Uniform

Weights and Measures Act adopted by many states says that one can sell small

berries, in this case strawberries, &quot;by weight or by volume&quot; and the

state inspectors decided in all their wisdom that a store cannot sell them both

by weight and by volume in the same store at the same time, although they could

sell by weight one day and the next day by the pint, half-pint, etc.   The store

commissioned a survey and over 80% wanted them sold both ways and the rest

didn't care.  Nevertheless, the state prohibited such a sale method    because

it would confuse patrons as to which was the better deal.  As a result, the

little old lady must by an entire half pint with the mouldy ones at the bottom

in order to have strawberries for her cereal.  She cannot buy just two hand

picked strawberries.  Or else she can only buy by the pound.  It is up to the

store to decide the only way to sell 'em that day and she cannot choose.  They

are prohibited from entering any other sold of a sale method than one of the two

mentioned above at a single time.  The case name is Baker's vs. Dept. of

Agriculture, and is only 2 weeks old. [as of Jan. 4, 1996--JAMM]</TT>
