<h3><a name="Historical">Strawberry Historical Facts</a></h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Strawberries are thought to have been cultivated in ancient Rome.</li>
<li>The strawberry, as we know it, was originally grown in northern Europe, but
species are also found in Russia, Chile, and the United States.</li>
<li>The berries seem to be <em>strewn</em> among the leaves of the plant. The
plant first had the name <em>strewberry</em>, which later was changed to
<em>strawberry</em>.</li>
<li>In France strawberries were cultivated in the 13th Century for useas a
medicinal herb. </li>
<li>Historical Medicinal Uses of <em>Fragaria Vesca</em> (Alpine
Strawberry):<br>
It is said that the leaves, roots and fruits of this variety of strawberry were
used for a digestive or skin tonic. Internally, the berry was used for
diarrhoea and digestive upset, while the leaves and the roots were used for
gout. Externally, it was used for sunburn and skin blemishes, and the fruit
juice was used for discoloured teeth.</li>
<li>The first American species of strawberries was cultivated about 1835. </li>
<li>The first important American variety, the Hoveg, was grown in 1834, in
Massachusetts. The hybrid variety was developed in France. </li>
<li>The strawberry is considered one of the most important small fruits grown
in the Western Hemisphere. Today every state in the United States and every
province in Canada grows the strawberry plant.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>The strawberry is a small plant of the <em>Rosaceae</em> (Rose) family. 
    All varieties of the strawberry plant belong to the <em>Fragaria</em> genus.</li>
  <li>It grows both as a wild plant and as a cultivated plant.</li>
  <li>Some strawberries, called <em>everbearing</em>, produce berries throughout 
    the summer and fall.</li>
  <li>Strawberry plants can be planted in any garden soil. But the richer the 
    soil, the larger the crop. The plant grows best in a cool, moist climate and 
    does not do well in warm temperatures. The plants may be planted in the spring 
    or fall, but if the temperature is too cold, fall planting requires a great 
    deal of care.</li>
  <li>The strawberry grows close to the ground on the stem in groups of three. 
    The greenish white fruits turn to a rich red colour when they ripen. When 
    the strawberry ripens, the petals of the flower fall off and all that remains 
    is the calyx, a leafy substance shaped like a star. Not every flower produces 
    fruit.</li>
  <li>Strawberries are not really berries or fruit in the "botanical" sense (i.e., 
    the end result of a fertilized plant ovum). A strawberry is actually an "aggregate 
    fruit" -- the "real" fruit are the objects we think of as the "strawberry 
    seed" -- properly called "achenes" -- which are fruits in the same way that 
    a raw sunflower seed with it's tough shell is a fruit. The "berry" is actually 
    an "enlarged receptacle" and is not reproductive material. As a result, strawberries 
    must be picked at full ripeness, as they cannot not ripen once picked.</li>
  <li>The strawberry plant has seeds on the outside skin rather than having an 
    outer skin around the seed, as most berries do. They do not however, normally 
    reproduce by seeds. When the fruit is developing, the plant sends out slender 
    growths called runners. These look like strings. They grow on the ground and 
    send out roots in the soil. The roots produce new plants which grow and bear 
    fruit. Sometimes these plants are taken from the soil and replanted to start 
    a new plantation of strawberry plants. </li>

Cup Planter (aka Ceramic Strawberry Pot)</em></a></strong><br>
From: Geoff Mott, Vancouver, BC</p>
<dl>

<dd> <ol>
<li>Sufficient rich soil to fill planter.</li>
<li>Fertilizer <ol type="a">
<li>Dried Manure (City Dwellers) or</li>
<li>6 - 10 - 10 Plant Food. (For Strawberries the middle number should be high

</ol>
</li>
<li>Non-waxed paper tube from a paper towel roll.</li>
<li>Gravel - Small pea size. Enough to fill paper tube.</li>
<li>Strawberry Plants<br>
Suggestions: <ol type="a">
<li>&quot;TOTEM&quot; June bearing - Big, Juicy, Sweet</li>
<li>&quot;TRI-STAR&quot; Everbearing, Medium size, not as juicy but very nice. 
</li>
<li>&quot;PINK PANDA&quot; New hybrid, has pink flowers, blooms constantly,
bright, small red fruit, very tasty.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Procedure:</dt>
<dd> <ol>
<li>Start with empty pot</li>
<li>If possible mix rich soil 50/50 with bagged dried manure, or mix in 1/2 cup
of 6-10-10 plant food.</li>
<li>Place paper tube vertically in center of pot</li>
<li>Fill paper tube with gravel and leave tube in pot. The paper tube and

<p><strong><a name="Hints-Deterring"><em>Deterring Birds</em></a></strong><br>
From: Kristine Adam, Coquitlam, BC</p>
<blockquote> <p>&quot;When I was growing up in Northern BC I knew someone who
came up with an interesting way of keeping birds out of the strawberry patch:
Early in the year, before the strawberries were even close to ripening, small,
strawberry sized rocks that had been painted red would be scattered throughout
the patch. Birds would then try to eat the 'berries' they thought they saw,
finding them hard and inedible. The birds would eventually give up on the
patch, leaving the <em>real</em> berries alone when they finally ripened later
in the year.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr width="25%" align="LEFT">
<p><strong><a name="Hints-Deterring2"><em>More on Deterring
Birds</em></a></strong><br>
From: Julie B., Australia</p>
<blockquote> <p>&quot;To keep birds off my strawberry patch in Australia , old
fly wire seems to do the trick nicely.&quot;<br>
[fly wire is the wire mesh found in a screen door --JAMM]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr width="25%" align="LEFT">
<p><strong><a name="Hints-FirstYear"><em>First Year Plants Produce Better
Berries</em></a></strong><br>
From: Dan Skousen, Spanish Fork, Utah</p>
<blockquote> <p>&quot;I have been able to get a fine crop of strawberries each
year by making certain that my plants are all first year plants, i.e. they have
only gone through one winter. No, I don't go out each year and buy new plants.
Instead, each spring I clear a two to three foot square patch in the middle of
my berries and alternatingly leave another two to three foot patch alone. The
ending result looks like a checker board. This is also a good time to mulch and
prepare the bared soil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the summer, the plants will send out new shoots to the bare
spots, and become established. I don't usually get many good berries off of
these new ones that season (growing season is rather short here in Spanish
Fork, Utah), but next year, what a crop! Big berries that are plump, sweet, and
juicy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, next year I clear the opposite patches that I had cleared
last spring. The result is a constant supply of young healthy plants that
produce fantastic berries. Try it, and with a little patience (say a couple
years), you too will see some great results.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a name="Hints-SinglePlant"><em>Tip For Tending a Single Strawberry
Bush</em></a></strong><br>
From: Anat Golan</p>
<blockquote> <p>&quot;Each morning, spray water from a spray bottle (such as a
window-cleaner bottle) on the plants. Every 2-3 days, give the plants a half
cup of water. This really makes them fresh and red!&quot;</p>

<strong>Systematics and Geographic Distribution of the American
Strawberry</strong><br>
<cite>by Gunter Staudt </cite><br>
<font size="-1"><strong>Description from Amazon.com:</strong><br>
In this detailed investigation of the natural variation, geographical
distribution, and modern taxonomy of the American Fragaria strawberry species,
three species with four subspecies each and two hybrid species are recognized
taxonomically. The author also discusses the phylogenetic relationships of the
diploid and octoploid species and subspecies and their postpleistocene
migration. The American octoploid Fragaria species are known as the ancestors
of the large-fruited garden strawberries, so this study is of great
horticultural interest and may contribute to the preservation of these species
and their further use in strawberry breeding. </font><br>
