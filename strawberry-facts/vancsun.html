<LI><A NAME="Choc-n-IceCrm"><STRONG>The simplest dinner party   dessert.</STRONG></A><BR>

  Top premium vanilla ice cream with sliced strawberries and sprinkle the   

berries with semi-sweet Belgian chocolate, cut in slivers off the block.    

Chocoholic guests will appreciated you even more if you bring a dish of  

chocolate slivers to the table and let them add chocolate at will.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Dipped"><STRONG>Chocolate dipped strawberries.</STRONG></A><BR>

  Pick out 12 large ones, with the stems attached.  Melt 3 oz. (85 g.) of   

Belgian semi-sweet chocolate, 1 tbsp. (15 mL.) of butter and 1 tsp. (5 mL.) of  

 Cognac, brandy or orange liqueur in a double boiler over hot water, or in    a

microwave oven.  Dip the strawberries halfway into the chocolate and set    them

on a plate covered with a sheet of wax paper.  Refrigerate them just    long

enough for the chocolate to set (about 10 minutes).  Eat them the    day you

make them.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Fool"><STRONG>Strawberry fool.</STRONG></A><BR>   Whip 1/2 cp.

(125 mL.) whipping cream and stir in 3/4 cp. (175 mL.)    of dairy sour cream or

<EM>cr&eacute;am fraiche</EM>.  Then make a decision:     Do you want a smooth

fool or a lumpy fool?  If the answer is smooth,    puree 4 cp. (1 L.) of berries

with 1/2 cp. (125 mL.) sugar (less if they taste    sweet enough) in a blender

or food processor.  Fold the cream into    the fruit puree and chill.  If you

want a lumpy fool, mash the    strawberries and sugar together with a potato

masher, then fold in    the cream.  You'll have enough to serve four.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Crepes"><STRONG>Instant strawberry and chocolate    crepes.</STRONG></A><BR>

  For each serving you need 1 small flour tortilla, 1 tbsp. (15 mL.) to   2

tbsp. (30 mL.) of chopped Belgian chocolate and 1/2 cp. (125 mL.) of sliced   

berries.  Sprinkle the tortilla with the chocolate and place on a paper    towel

in the microwave.  Heat at HIGH for 30 seconds.  Put the    strawberries in the

centre of the tortilla and roll it up.  If you are    civilized, you can eat

this with a knife and fork.  For the maximum    feeling of guilty pleasure, pick

it up and eat it out of your hands.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Balsamic"><STRONG>Strawberries in Balsamic   vinegar.</STRONG></A><BR>

  Wash and hull 4 cp. (1 L.) strawberries, cut into quarters.  Sprinkle   them

with 3 tbsp. (45 mL.) of balsamic vinegar and 3 tbsp. (45 mL.) sugar;   combine

well and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or as long    as 4 hours.  Divide

berries among 4 dessert dishes.  Just before    serving, sprinkle with freshly

ground pepper.  The big surprise:     when pepper is first ground, it has an

overtone of sweetness.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Ice"><STRONG>Strawberry ice.</STRONG></A><BR>   Any time in the

week or so before you want to make strawberry ice, combine    2/3 cp. (150 mL.)

sugar and 2/3 cp. (150 mL.) water in a medium saucepan and    bring it to a

boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Lower the heat    and simmer for 5

minutes, then cool to room temperature and refrigerate    until cold. When

you're ready to make dessert, hull 6 cp. (1.5 L.)    of strawberries and puree

them.  You should have about 3 cp. (750 mL.) puree.    In a large bowl, combine

the pureed strawberries, sugar syrup and    1/4 cp. (50 mL.) of lemon juice. 

Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker    and freeze.  You'll get about 4 cp.

(1 L.) of bright red, thirst-quenching    ice.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Wine"><STRONG>Strawberries in red wine.</STRONG></A><BR>   For

each serving, spoon 3/4 cp. (175 mL.) quartered fresh strawberries into a  

large wine glass.  Sprinkle with 1-1/2 tsp. (7 mL.) sugar, 1 tsp. (5 mL.)   

orange-flavoured liqueur and 1/2 tsp. (2 mL.) Cognac.  Fill each glass with   

red wine to cover the berries.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Cheese"><STRONG>Strawberries with sweet   cheese.</STRONG></A><BR>

  Beat 1/2 cp. (125 mL.) mascarpone cheese with 1 tbsp. (15 mL.) sugar and   

1/2 cp. (125 mL.) whipping cream.  Hull and halve 4 cp. (1 L.) strawberries.    

Pour 2 tbsp. (30 mL.) to 3 tbsp. (45 mL.) creme de cassis into each of 4 dessert

   dishes.  Add a quarter of the berries, reserving a few for garnishing,   

then top with 1/4 cp. (50 mL.) of the cheese mixture and decorate with the   

reserved fruit.  

<P>   </P></LI>

<LI><A NAME="Romanoff"><STRONG>Strawberries Romanoff.</STRONG></A><BR>  

Hull 4 cp. (1 L.) of strawberries and cut them in half.  Place in a bowl   and

toss with 2 tbsp. (30 mL.) of sugar, then divide the strawberries    equally

among 4 dessert dishes.  Whip 1/2 cp. (125 mL.) of whipping cream.     Whip 1

cp. (250 mL.) ice cream slightly and fold in the whipped cream.  Add    3 tbsp.

(45 mL.) orange liqueur, if you like.  Then top the berries with    the cream

and serve immediately.
